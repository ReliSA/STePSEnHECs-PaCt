# Contribution guidlines
* Any contributions are wellcome in a form of pull requests so they can be reviewed and adjusted to ensure catalogue consistency.
* This includes adding new patterns/facets as well as editing the existing ones, even proposal to change the classification or overall structure of the catalogue and its meta information (e.g., these very contribution guidelines).
* Use [templates](https://github.com/ReliSA/STePSEnHECs-PaCt/tree/main/templates) or existing pages as examples to help you to structure and link your contributions correctly.
* If you are not clear on any aspects of the stucture and inter-linking or are worried you might not apply them correctly, submit the pull request anyway and it will get resolved during its review. The templates exist mainly so that the review does not start from zero.
