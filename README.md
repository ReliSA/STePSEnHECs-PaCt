# Student Team Projects in Software Engineering Higher Education Courses (STePSEnHEC's) Patterns Catalogue (PaCt)

We started this catalogue to collect and consolidate the knowledge on teaching (primarily) software engineering courses with team student project in higher education in form of patterns. To put it simply, patterns are regularly occurring solutions to common problems in the given domain with positive effects.  This catalogue is an on-going effort with the aim to create a space where the wider community can contribute and thus, together we can reconcile the various sources and foster discussion on understanding and descriptions of the individual patterns. So feel free to fork this repository and send us pull requests when you have something to contribute.

## Patterns catalogue

The [catalogue](Patterns_catalogue.md) proper.

### Common context

The patterns in this catalogue are meant to be applied in higher education software engineering courses that include student projects. However, some of the patters can be useful in other conditions as well and some were even intended for broader or different settings by their authors.

### Faceted classification

List patterns by a selected [facet](catalogue/facets/facets.md)
- solution [form](catalogue/facets/forms/forms.md),
- project [methodology](catalogue/facets/methodologies/methodologies.md),
- [mode](catalogue/facets/modes/modes.md) of teaching,
- pattern [perspective](catalogue/facets/perspectives/perspectives.md),
- source [publication](catalogue/facets/publications/publications.md),
- project [stage](catalogue/facets/stages/stages.md),
- or miscellaneous [category](catalogue/facets/categories/categories.md).

## Notes

The original content of the catalogue (as of 2025) is based on a review of academic, professional and grey literature sources to collect the currently known and/or defined relevant patterns.  It uses a description template designed to support ease of use and understanding.
