# 2+2 makes four eyes - Grading individuals is teamwork

## [Facets](facets/facets.md)

[Category](facets/categories/categories.md): [Grading](facets/categories/Grading.md)

## Context

Grading individuals in project groups should not be solo work, the teachers should actively consult on the grades. But before that the teachers should prepare. Both could become a time consuming exercise as the pitfall is diving into every detail every student has provided.

## Problem

How do you smoothly determine together who deserves a grade that deviates from the group grade?

## Forces

 - **Working alone is tempting.** It enables a teacher to set their own pace, choose your own focus points and finish the process whenever they like, even if is it is in the middle of the night.
 - **Experienced colleagues pressing.** If the teacher team consists of one experienced and one less experienced teacher it is tempting for the more experienced colleague to try to accelerate the process by pressing their findings through to the others. After all, everyone benefits from the shortest possible process. That this might not do the students and their colleagues right, could seem almost of secondary importance, because there is time pressure.

## Solution

The solution balances working alone and working together. After a quick consultation amongst the teachers, in which work is divided and timelines are agreed, a two parts process takes place. The first part, Individual preparation, consists of a triangulation process, leading to a proposal for a grade. This process is depicted in figure 1. The second part consists of a teachers meeting where the final decisions on the grades are made. This process is depicted in figure 2.
<ul>    
    <li><b>Quick consultation</b>      
    <ul>        
        <li><b><i>Divide the work.</i></b> Although we hold the principle that all work is seen through four eyes this does not mean that everyone has to look at everything equally thorough. Therefore agree with your colleagues who will go into depth for which sections of the work, and who will form an opinion in a more limited time box. Moreover, uncovering the metrics (see [Whodunnit? - Using metrics in a fair way](Whodunnit.md)), can be done in one effort by one person.          
        </li>        
        <li><b><i>A workable deadline.</i></b> As a rule of thumb: if you are completely focused, you could grade approximately 20-25 students a day. If you do more you will probably get less efficient. Take this into account, together with some leeway relative to the deadline for entering the grades in the system, when agreeing on the date for meeting in person with your colleagues.          
        </li>    
    </ul>    
    </li>    
    <li><b>Individual preparation</b>      
    <ul>        
        <li><b><i>Triangulate when you prepare.</i></b> Although holistic is the way to go in establishing the final grade, there are too much ECTS at stake to ’just’ cast a grade on the basis of the teachers own observations during the project. Validation of observations needs to take place. By triangulating your observations during the project period, with objective metrics and student’s accounts for their individual contributions to the project, the teacher will lift their confidence in the judgments they make. These three corners of the triangulation are patterns on their own, see [Lest not forget - Collecting observations](Lest_not_forget.md), [Whodunnit? - Using metrics in a fair way](Whodunnit.md) and [Face their facts - Student’s accountability](Face_their_facts.md).          
        <ul>            
            <li>In <b>step 1</b> (see figure 1), <b>the teacher formulates their private opinion</b> on every single student on the basis of their observations during the project. Who stood out, positively as well as negatively? Mind that this is not just a random opinion, or a gut feeling. This opinion is grounded in their observations during the project. [Lest not forget - Collecting observations](Lest_not_forget.md), Lest not forget, provides a separate pattern for the way this could be established. If an individual student did better or worse than their team mates, formulate: on which points? Was it a quantitative or qualitative difference? Which (mental) notes do you take from this? These notes help you to keep focused during the rest of the grading process.              
            </li>            
            <li>In <b>step 2</b> the teacher <b>focuses solely on the measured quantity of the student’s work.</b> The question is now: "Do the numbers the tool stack provides give reason to dive deeper into the work of any specific student?" Come to a stand-still and decide: which work/students are you in doubt about? Mind again that this doubt can be either positively or negatively: you can very well be in doubt if someone deserves an upgrade. [Whodunnit? - Using metrics in a fair way](Whodunnit.md), provides a separate pattern for the way to handle quantitative metrics.              
            </li>            
            <li>In <b>step 3</b> you <b>check on the information the students provided.</b> You start with the ones you think have performed average. If their information is complete and you do not see any remarkable things, no further work is needed. The doubtful ones need a more thorough look: Does the student proof evidence that they are competent on all desired learning outcomes, including the focus points you decided on in step 1? [Face their facts - Student’s accountability](Face_their_facts.md), provides a pattern for the way you can get the information you need.              
            </li>        
        </ul>        
        </li>        
        <li><b><i>Decide on the amount of up- or downgrade grade you are going to propose to your colleague.</i></b> This is, of course, based in the principles from the basic pattern. If you asked students to take notes during the project (see [Lest not forget - Collecting observations](Lest_not_forget.md)), you might consult them. And, if students have written peer feedback during the project, and you trust its value, you might also take a peep and check if your proposal is endorsed by it. If not, stop thinking and take the case to the teachers meeting. This step is depicted as number 4 in figure 1.          
        </li>    
    </ul>    
    </li>    
    <li><b>Teachers meeting</b>      
    <ul>        
        <li><b>Setting the stage for discussion on ’the doubtful ones’.</b> Once the teachers meeting starts, first select those students who you are both not in doubt about. This sets the stage for focusing on the cases in which:          
        <ul>            
            <li>(1) Your proposed grades deviate significantly from each other. A rule of thumb for this significance is: a difference of 1 point or more on a 1-10 scale.              
            </li>            
            <li>(2) One of the teachers thinks a student ’floats around’ the pass/fail point.              
            </li>            
            <li>(3) One of the teachers thinks a student needs to fail.              
            </li>        
        </ul>        
        </li>        
        <li><b>Share findings and counter check.</b> Now both teachers share their findings on the doubtful ones, and if necessary counter check them by consulting the work and tool stack again. Most of the times this leads to a mutual understanding and therefore to agreement on the grade.          
        </li>        
        <li><b>Assessment in person.</b> If there are doubts left after the counter check, the teachers can decide tp ask the student to come and show evidence in person. This should take no longer than 10 minutes as the student is only asked to proof designated subjects: "we thought we saw you working on subject X, but we did find that, could you please explain and show if we oversaw it?" or "are we right that we did not see you work on...?".          
        </li>        
        <li><b>Underpin the grades and register.</b> If a student fails, the teachers provide one single written example per failed learning outcome, to underpin the fail. Only if a student comes and asks for explanation, you will give them more examples in person.          
        </li>    
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

## Consequences

 - (+) By asking teachers to prepare, the teacher team will have level playing field, instead of one teacher pressing their findings to the others. This results in building trust within the team.
 - (+) Although setting up the process is a bit of work, this process reassures you that grading is a team effort, which means teachers know they are not on their own
 - (-) The possibility of false positives (students who pass while they actually needed to fail) is bigger in the case of a very good group grade. When sticking to the equal pigs-statement too much, it some teachers find it difficult to downgrade someone from a very good pass for the group work as a whole, to an individual fail.
 - (-) The less experienced and the more doubtful the teachers in the team are, the longer the teachers meeting could last, and the more prone the team will be to still write in depth feedback.
 - (-) If you are late to agree on a date for the teachers meeting, some teachers might be forced to work outside office hours in order to be well prepared. This could still enhance the feeling of being on your own.
