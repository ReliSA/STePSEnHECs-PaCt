## Context

You are a college level educator doing most of or all your teaching online.

## Problem

The digital tools you use for your online classes will have a big impact on the quality of your classes. They are the foundation of the daily work for both you and your students. There are many tools on the market with overlapping or similar functionality, but there is also significant differences in usability and performance of these tools. The tools may have many features that you do not need that make them more complex to use.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, select digital tooling that supports the basic needs of both the teacher and the students in a way that provides a positive user experience for both. It is good if the Learning Management System (LMS) supports low end/low-cost tools like Chromebook or even cell phones. The business logic should run on the server side while the students only need the browser and credentials. Additional tools can either be provided by the college together with the LMS system, or you can use free tools or tools that have good discounts for students. The more you learn about utilizing the tools you selected (or that were selected by your college), the better you can support your students and get the most out of the online experience. If you and/or your students have limited bandwidth you need to avoid the need to use cameras and features that are data intensive. An LMS system that incorporates most of your needs (online materials, scheduling and running lectures, student assignments, test management, and some level of collaboration) may provide the best support from an ecosystem perspective, while adding some external tooling for less critical tasks can spice up the course and make it less monotonous.
