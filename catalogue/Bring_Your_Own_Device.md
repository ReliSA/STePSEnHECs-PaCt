## Synopsis

Students use their own personal devices to contribute to activities both inside and outside of the classroom. They have the responsibility to install the required apps.

## Context

Most students have their own powerful smartphones that they bring to school or university anyway. Sometimes they also own powerful tablets or computers. Many learning and creating activities can benefit from using digital devices. Every student needs a powerful computing device to do research, experiments, productive and creative tasks.

## Problem

Devices provided by organizations often do not fit to the needs of students who have already their preferred and customized working environments. If a device does not provide the expected or accustomed features, productivity, motivation and learning outcomes decrease.

## Forces

 - All students should have devices with similar capabilities.
 - Students are more productive with their own devices than those supplied by the institution.
 - There are lower or zero low learning curves if students use their own environments.
 - There is a higher emotional attachment to one’s own devices.
 - Moreover, many students have customized the devices according to their individual need and learning habits.
 - Learning activities often require specific apps but students have their own preferences which apps to use.
 - Moreover, students need a place to store individual work and private information.
 - The computing device should always be available, at school, at home and “on the street” when doing research.

## Solution

Therefore, let students bring their own personal devices and use them in classes to work on activities.

## Implementation 

You have to ensure easy access to the network for personal devices. You should also ensure that all students have similar capabilities on their devices. Establish minimum requirements and offer support to finance more powerful devices if needed. Establish rules which apps needs to be installed. Provide licenses for software that needs to be installed.

In our practical assignments for programming (at TH Köln), most students bring their own laptops and work with their preferred integrated development environment (IDE). While they have access to a computer pools with a setup working environment, most students prefer to work on their own laptops with their own file structure and setup. In project-based work assignments, students can use their mobile phones for research in the field. They can run interviews with other people, capture data and make pictures. They bring their own phones to the classroom to show and share the results.

## Consequences

 - (+) Students can choose their preferred device. They can organize data and information in a way that fits best to their learning style. They have access to the learning device all the time. Moreover, they learn to be responsible for setting up the system according to the requirements. You do not need to maintain the devices centrally.
 - (-) Students may have devices with different setups. More powerful devices could mean an advantage over less powerful devices – making education less fair, in the worst case there could be a "digital divide".
 - (-) Individual devices come with a large variety of setups. If one device does not work as supposed, it may be very difficult to find the error. A teacher can hardly provide tech support.
 - (-) As the students are responsible to maintain their devices and install apps and software as required, you may find situations where not all students have prepared their devices properly.
 - (-) License management for software can take a lot of time, and distributing licenses to students can be more expensive than purchasing licenses for a fixed number of devices owned by the school.
