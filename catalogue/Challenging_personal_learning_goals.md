## Context

Compared to study courses that focus on specific topics (e.g., programming in Java, algorithms and data-structures, mathematics), the learning context in study projects is way more complex. Likewise considering the individual progression of students in a team is difficult. Students have different expertise, skills, problems, and preferences that they bring into the project. While one student may use the project as an opportunity to improve specific technical skills, another student may use it to improve project management or communication skills. Therefore, in our student projects, every student must identify and manage personal learning goals explicitly. These goals are regularly revisited and considered when grading the students.

## Problem

As a teacher, how can you support students with defining and working on meaningful and challenging personal learning goals?

## Forces

 - ***Personal learning goals are prioritized the lowest by students.*** All other necessary project work is more interesting to them.
 - ***If students are not particularly good at introspection***, finding suitable goals can be hard.
 - ***Students who lack endurance tend to set goals they think the teacher might like***, rather than goals that help them become a better software engineer/ team player.
 - ***Many students choose trivial and not so challenging learning goals.*** This often results in a lack of progress and is always a missed opportunity. In our experience, students who set challenging learning goals progress significantly better than students who do not.
 - ***Students tend to entangle goal and meaning.*** They are prone to the pitfall that the goal is performing certain actions, instead of learning from those actions.
 - ***Some goals are inappropriate for the project.*** An introvert student may, for instance, have the goal to become more extraverted, but this goal is unrealistic for an 8-weeks project. As a teacher you need to resist this kind of life changing goal: this is not a course in psychology. It is about dealing more effectively with being who you are, specifically your collaboration skills, in the context of an ICT-project.

Students tend to show resistance against thinking about and consistently working on personal learning goals.

We aim for students to challenge themselves to become even better team players than they already are. In terms of the four stages of competence [[CUR'73]](../References.md) we want them to become consciously competent.

## Solution

Our solution consists of four steps. First, you must find suitable subjects. The next step is to define the learning goal and the intended results. This gives you the opportunity to identify the required actions to work towards the results. Finally, to keep the pace, make sure to stay on top of it during the process. The next sections will provide detailed suggestions for each of the steps.

**Step 1: Where to find suitable subjects?** To have personal learning goals for each student, you must find suitable subjects. But where can you find them? It is easily stated: A suitable learning goal is personal, gives students insight in how to prevent pitfalls and makes the student a better team player. But how do you help them in finding a suitable one or two?

First talk with the students about a suitable subject. This is not yet the goal, but they need to find a starting point for thinking about their goals. Here are some suggestions for letting students think back and forward.

To let students think ‘backwards’, we suggest to:
 - Let them state what behavior they want to improve
 - Let students think of earlier projects: what feedback did they get?

To let students think ‘forward’, we suggest asking them:
 - What do they think they will get as feedback at the end of the project?
 - What do they not look forward to in the project, what do they assume will be difficult (e.g., asking questions to colleagues who are cleverer than you are)?

**Step 2: Goals and results.** Once the subjects are chosen it gets easier. Agree with them on a place where they record their findings and where you can see immediate progress (a wiki, or a google drive document works verry well) and let them write down:
 - The subject
 - Why is it a problem, what is my pitfall on this?
 - If the problem is smaller in future: why will I be a better team player in a software engineering project?
 - The goal is mostly formulated in terms of: I want to have better insights in the way I deal with . . . or: what can I do to prevent myself from falling into my usual pitfall of . . . ?
 - The result could be: At the end of the project, I will have a list of tips & tricks for myself to use when in future I encounter similar circumstances

**Step 3: Working towards results.** Most students want to solve their problems in just one step which consists of: doing what I avoided doing until now. E.g., if a student wants to be a little more assertive in certain situations, s/he states: “I just start talking more in product delivery meetings”. But was it not the problem that s/he did not talk enough? Why would it work now? The solution is making it smaller: taking many small steps and evaluating and:
 - Let the students formulate small experiments: what could they do to challenge themselves? In what upcoming situation will they take which action? E.g., the person who wants to avoid his pitfall of unassertiveness, could formulate: “when preparing the next meeting with the product owner I will be the chair”
 - Evaluate the experiments: how well did I do it and: how easily did I do it? Did it help to be more assertive? Let them write it down. If they do not, they will end up telling you ‘I did everything intended’, but are not able to reflect on it
 - Let them formulate the next action, and iterate
 - At the end of the project, discuss with the student: which actions are useful in future projects? How did s/he advance on the topic of assertiveness? What challenges remain?

**Step 4: Stay on top of it.** As learning goals are prioritized low by students, you as a teacher must make sure the subject is on the agenda during your meetings with them at least every week.
 - Make it a habit to check the learning goal documents every time you meet with the team, and talk to them about their achievements and your expectations every time you meet the team.
