## Context

You want to enable every student to communicate with other students.

## Problem

Some classes have team work assignments and students need to find partners to work with. This is harder for online classes where the students donâ€™t get to hang out and meet in the classroom. Knowing some fellow students can enable informal study groups, and some students find it easier to ask questions to other students than to the teacher. Students who are shy find it harder to reach out to fellow students.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, create a peer buddy from the start of the semester to seed student to student interaction. The peer buddy structure could be one to one or smaller groups of 3-4 people. It may be based on the [Personal Introductions](Personal_Introductions.md) matching up people based on similar interests, experience and/or geographical locations and time zones.
