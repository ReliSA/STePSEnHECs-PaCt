## Context

In a coding workshop, different contents, which are related to a bigger topic, are taught. Even if these topics belong to a common domain, they are initially treated separately and independently of each other. This approach aligns with the principle of ”Divide & Conquer”, breaking down complex subjects into smaller, more manageable units. Furthermore, in consideration of the cognitive load theory, the separate introduction of individual theory leads to a reduction in the cognitive burden on participants [[PAA'16]](../References.md).

## Problem

Participants are unable to detect the relevance of the individual topics in relation to each other and to the common topic. This lowers the motivation of the participants and thus reduces their commitment to the workshop.

## Forces

 - **Domain specific knowledge:** Since the taught topics are new to the participants, not everyone has the domain specific knowledge for the common topic.
 - **Limited attention span:** Participants only have a limited attention span and can therefore not memorize all individual topics [EZE'17].
 - **Engagement:** Initially seemingly unrelated topics can reduce participant engagement.
 - **Purpose:** Participants might not see the purpose in learning seemingly unrelated topics.
 - **Application of knowledge:** It might be hard for participants to apply individual topics in the real world without further context.

## Solution

*Implement a moment in the workshop where all previous topics are connected and put in relation.*

During the workshop, there should be a moment when the topics that have so far been considered independently of each other are placed in relation to each other and to the common theme. It is important that participants can see and understand a coherent picture from the individual topics. At this point, the topics should also be placed in relation to the general domain. The appropriate time to connect the pieces can either be towards the end or after each individual subtopic that adds to the greater domain.

The presented solution can also be applied to the running example. Connect the pieces should act as the highlight of the workshop. Applying this to the topic of learning basic algorithms, a possible outcome can be the linking of previously learned algorithms, which at first may seem to be unrelated to each other. Another possibility is to show how the previous algorithms can act as a foundation for a bigger and more complex algorithm.

## Consequences

 - (+) Linking multiple topic together leads to a **deeper understanding**.
 - (+) Recognizing relations between topic and their relevance can increase participants’ **motivation**.
 - (+) Linking previous topic together can be a **highlight** of the workshop.
 - (+) The linking of topics gives **more structure** to the workshop.
 - (+) Linking topic together can trigger a **surprise effect** for the participants.
 - (+) Recognizing relations between topics can motivate participants to **dive further** into a topic on their own.
 - (+) The separation into different subtopics in the beginning inherently conveys the divide and conquer paradigm, which plays an important role in the realm of computer science [[SCH'94]](../References.md).
 - (-) The linking of topics needs to be planned and therefore leads to an **increased preparation effort**.
 - (-) To recognize all relations between topics, **every individual topic must be understood** at least to a certain degree.
 - (-) Linking multiple topics and therefore summarize them again, can be seen as a **redundancy** from the participants which can lower the attention.
 - (-) Not every topic can be **partitioned** into small logical chunks.

|Pattern|Relation type|Relation description|
|--|--|--|
|Hidden Connections [[IBA'09]](../References.md)|aligns with|Hidden Connection supports the idea of finding hidden connections among topic. The allows for a new perspective on already known topics and therefore aligns with the concept of Connect the pieces to paint a bigger picture for workshop participants.|
|Larger than Life [[ECK'02]](../References.md)|counterpart|Larger than life supports the idea of giving students a big complex topic upfront and slowly work towards that topic. Even though this is contrary to Connect the Pieces, a switch in perspective could be used in a coding workshop.|
