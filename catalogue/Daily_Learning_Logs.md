## Context

You want to help the students interact with the class contents.

## Problem

In a virtual setting it is harder for the teacher to know what the students are gaining from the class, especially for students who are not active verbally during the class sessions. For students the amount of material can be overwhelming, and unless they process it gradually during the semester, they can easily feel lost and give up on the class.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, ask the students to run a daily log to create a lowprofile ongoing engagement based on questions like:
 - List the main concept(s) that were discussed today.
 - Choose one of these concepts and explain what skills are needed to understand and/or apply it.
 - Give a brief explanation of the concept.
 - How did you participate in class today?
 - What emotions did you feel today?
 - Additional Comments
For the student, keeping a log where they reflect on what they have learned and where they can organize and summarize the course contents is an exercise in Writing to Learn that shows good results in maturing and taking ownership of the knowledge. By sharing the log with the teacher helps the educator in understanding if the course content is understood and if something needs to be elaborated on in the classes. Even more it allows the teacher to gauge the motivation of the students, as it helps them not only reflect on the essence of the contents, but the log provides them with a way to express their feelings and to know that the educator is there for them.
