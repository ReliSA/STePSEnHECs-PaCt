## Context

## Problem

If the work product/s delivered on the date of the deadline are incomplete or not of sufficient quality regarding the defined requirements, then the grading of these products will be low.

## Forces

## Solution

Start working on the assignment immediately and keep track of the progress of the assignment. Adjust the planning so that the most important assignment parts can be finished on time and in sufficient quality. Distribute the tasks evenly. Make the planning so that you have sufficient time to check the quality of the deliverables before delivery according to defined criteria.
