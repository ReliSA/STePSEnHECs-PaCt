## Synopsis

Have a cabinet with standardized tablets: same configuration and same apps.

## Context

Many learning and creating activities can benefit from using digital devices.

## Problem

You need to make sure that all students have exactly the same setup and can start working right away.

## Forces

 - You want to give free access to digital devices.
 - You can use special computer rooms with your students but this makes planning a course more difficult because you depend on the scheduled time slots.
 - A computer room also sets a mindset that using the computer is something special.
 - However, the computer should be tackled as a regular tool that is used at appropriate times.
 - There is a risk that dedicated time slots for computer use leads to an overuse of the device (when you use it because “you can” and not because “it fits to the task”).
 - An alternative would be to equip each room with computers but this is very cost intensive and there might be a dominance of technology in the classroom.
 - Special devices, such as tablets with pen, new smartphones with special sensors, are often not owned by all students. Moreover not all students have the same software installed.
 - To ensure that each device has the same setup, the school should provide the devices.
 - However, if the school provides the devices, the budget constraints the number of available devices.
 - If there are not enough devices for each student, the same devices need to be used in several classrooms.
 - Using the same devices in several classes can save money, compared to buying devices for each student.
 - Such shared digital devices need to be maintained and there is a need to charge the battery for each time the devices are used.

## Solution

Therefore, have a cabinet with standardized tablets: the same configuration, same apps.

## Implementation 

The setup of the tablets can be exactly as needed for the learning scenario. It is ensured that all students have equal equipment. No one is left behind. The devices can be charged in the cabinet. Cabinets can be moved from one room to another.

## Consequences

 - (+) All students have access to the same powerful devices. Maintenance and software installation can be done centrally. You can provide special devices that are not standard among students. You can use the devices in different classrooms or labs. You know exactly the setup of the devices, hence, support is simpler. If one device fails to work, you can use another device, if you have some spare devices.
 - (-) Standardized devices shared by different people are less personal. Individual work needs to be stored in the cloud or on data sticks. Taking personal pictures is not appropriate. If you want to buy new devices, it’s a huge investment since a complete set for many students needs to be bought.
 - (-) Using a different system in school and at home can be inefficient. There is a learning curve to get adjusted to the working mode of the new device at school. Moreover, switching between different device types can be confusing because each device offers different features.
