## Context

You want to engage students so that they can learn better about the course topics.

## Problem

The discussion board feature is common in Learning Management System (LMS) tooling. By participating in discussions around course topics the students can improve their understanding but often students are not familiar with these tools, donâ€™t like to write on the board, may feel that participating should be limited to one reply. This pattern illustrates the various concepts they need to learn, while also strengthening the bonding between the students in the class.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, encourage the use of the discussion board and make sure the students know that using it counts towards class participation. Some students will take to using it easily, and it can be a good alternative for students who are less comfortable talking in class. Be an active participant to stimulate good discussions and do not forget to use humor to engage. If you still feel that the uptake of the discussion board is too slow you can embed it into the learning by introducing contents there that are needed for upcoming assignments, and by actively using the discussion board during the online class sessions. If students send you questions you can encourage them to post it on the discussion board and then engage on the topic there actively pulling in more students in a dialogue. Create a point system for responses to encourage multiple replies by each student.
