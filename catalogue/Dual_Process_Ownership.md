## Context

## Problem

Students do not have enough experience to take on the Scrum Master (or equivalent) role fully, because it is a large part of what they are learning in the course itself.

## Forces

## Solution

**Use a mentor, an experienced staff member, as a crutch to help oversee, tailor and adhere to the teamâ€™s process. Simultaneously, have an internal process owner (an individual or the whole team, their choice), as the mentor cannot be present all the time.**
