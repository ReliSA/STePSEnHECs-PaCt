# Effective product delivery meetings

## [Category](categories/categories.md)

## Context

In fact, product delivery meetings are the team’s second, third etc. meetings with the customer. Product delivery meetings also result in more grip on the assignment, but now this is done by showing specific results, matching them to the expectations of the customer, and deciding how to move on [[SCH'20-2]](../References.md). In the agile world, product delivery meetings are called sprint reviews.

If the teacher does not interfere, a common way for a student’s team to prepare and perform (the first) sprint review is as follows: they work on all tasks until just before the meeting and merge the last code to the main branch 10 minutes before and demonstrate it to the product owner. At least three things will happen: 1) Of course the demonstration fails, as the application appears to be unstable, 2) When asked which agreed features are finished the team will start talking about tasks and requirements ‘almost nearly’ finished, 3) when asked about the reasons for the deficient performance the team will either stay silent, or the most talkative student provides explanations that have no common ground in the team.

## Problem

As a teacher, how can you prevent the team, and consequently the customer, from performing poorly during the product delivery meeting? Or, stated reversely: how to guide the team to meet the goals of the review meeting as stated in the Scrum guide.

## Forces

 - ***The team is so focused on getting code working*** that they tend to forget the rest of the definition of done (documentation, testing).
 - ***You must stay confident.*** Your patience will be tested very much: your assumption that it must be easy enough to finish the sprint backlog during the sprint will appear to be wrong. The team needs time to improve.

## Solution

**Retrospective before review.** Make sure that the product delivery meeting is preceded by an evaluation meeting. Scrum connoisseurs will note that this is contrary to the rules of Scrum where the sprint review is followed by the sprint retrospective meeting.

In doing so, you provide the team with an extra goal: their evaluation will not only help them to improve their processes but will also help them prepare a good sprint review meeting. Explain to them what will go wrong if they deliver to the customer first: they will lack answers to the customer’s obvious questions like: why did (not) you deliver what you promised? What went good wrong? Why? or What will you be able to deliver next sprint?

**Prepare an agenda for the meeting.** Help them prepare an agenda for the meeting, at least consisting of:
 - Getting back to sprint goal and agreed on backlog items
 - An honest analysis of quality, issues, and risks, based on their retrospective
 - A suitable demonstration/presentation of the results until now
 - Smart proposals for the next iteration

**Expectation management.** Help them with the concept of expectation management by:
 - Being strict: Tasks not adhering to the definition of done may not be reported as complete
 - Telling them to inform the product owner beforehand if the sprint goal will not be met.
 - Explaining to them the necessity of being critical regarding scope-changes and changing requirements.
