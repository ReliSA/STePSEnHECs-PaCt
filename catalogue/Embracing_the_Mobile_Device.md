## Context

You are teaching an online class for a diverse group of students.

## Problem

Not all your students may have easy access to powerful computers. Some may even use their smartphone to access the course and join the lessons and the testing sessions.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, design your course to enable students to take the class using only their mobile device. This will create some limitations and you need to make sure that the Learning Management System (LMS) system and other tooling will support mobile devices. Your students will appreciate it as it provides them more flexibility and they can access the class at any time where they are able to use their phone, making it possible to join a lecture on the commuter train from work or while visiting grandparents with no internet.
