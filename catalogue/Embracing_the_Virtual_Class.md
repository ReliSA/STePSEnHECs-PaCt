## Context

You are designing a new class to be taught online.

## Problem

It may feel very challenging to create your first online class. Suddenly you are not face to face with students while you are teaching and there is less opportunity to adjust you style and your contents on the fly based on the body language of your students. How will you know if they understand, and you can move on to new topics?

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, take advantage of the online medium when creating a class rather than trying to mimic the face to face classes from the past. Interaction with students are now asynchronous so give them a way to study, communicate, and ask questions at any time – this way they can engage when they have time, and you can build on the student community to provide feedback and engage through [Discussion Boards](Discussion_Board.md) and other tools like Miro or Mural where you can run interactive activities in a fun way. You will be able to judge student learning through their postings, but you will have to learn how to live with the fact that it is no longer real-time feedback.
