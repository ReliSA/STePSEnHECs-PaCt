# Evaluations to learn from

## Context

In an agile environment, evaluations take place at the end of every sprint. These evaluations are called retrospectives. During a retrospective, the team reflects on how the sprint went regarding people, relationships, process, and tools [[SCH'20-2]](../References.md). If performed well, retrospectives effectively support continuous improvement of the team-members with respect to their professional relationship, productivity, and quality of delivered work.

Many students initially see these sessions as a burden, rather than a chance for improvement. If not supervised carefully, students rush through them, without challenging themselves and without deriving suitable actions for improvement. Consequently, the evaluations have little value, which confirms the students’ negative preconceptions: a self-fulfilling prophecy.

## Problem

As a teacher, how do you supervise students during evaluations / retrospectives, so they are effective and comprehensibly valuable for the team as a whole and each learning individual in the team. Note that every student must perform on all defined learning outcomes. Therefore, the team cannot allow for too much specialization within the team.

## Forces

 - ***Students tend to underestimate the value of reflection.*** They are bad at understanding why they did the right things, and they feel bad about things that went wrong. No matter if the reflection is about specific potentials to improve the project (pace) or about software development in general. Both are reasons for avoiding reflecting.
 - ***Students must learn two things at one time:*** they must learn how to run a good retrospective and they must learn the benefits of it. So, one needs a retrospective on the retrospective. What worked well, what can be improved? This costs time, and the results of an evaluation will only show during the next sprint.
 - ***Evaluations tend to become ‘tea parties’***, in which students chat with each other without working towards specific goals. In doing so they prove to themselves that they could better spend their time on coding. Students act and communicate differently when the teacher is present. This often results in not addressing the problem behind the problem and being too optimistic about the probable success of their improvement measures.

## Solution

Sources on retrospectives focus on the Scrum master/team leader preparing the session [[SCH'20-1]](../References.md). On the contrary, our solution is to ask the team to prepare the retrospective thoroughly on team and personal levels. Discussing helps deepen their understanding of the team’s functioning and enables them to formulate smart goals for the next sprint.

Be present at the meetings, at least the first two or three times. If you see the students struggle, provide active support, or even take over a session as the moderator. If you do so, decide with the team on who of them will moderate the next session and ask this person to pay particular attention and take notes on how to moderate retrospectives.

<ul>
    <li><i>Measurable facts.</i> Ask the team to gather metrics about the last sprint prior to the meeting. This makes sure that the discussion during the meeting is based on facts, and that the performance during the sprint can be compared to prior sprints. The metrics we like to use are: 
    <ul>
        <li>How many person-hours were spent on tasks, compared to the estimated effort 
        </li>
        <li>Which tasks were added or changed after the sprint was started 
        </li>
        <li>Which tasks were under- or overestimated 
        </li>
        <li>What tasks were finished (corresponding to the definition of done) and what tasks had to be taken to the next sprint? 
        </li>
        <li>If coding is part of the work and the tool stack provides for data: code-metrics like lines of code, commits per person, pull requests per person, test coverage could be retrieved 
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><i>Personal perception.</i> Ask every member of the team to think of personal feedback for every other team member prior to the meeting. 
    </li>
</ul>

Make sure that the personal feedback round is done seriously, honestly and unharmful. Feedback is always aimed at better teamwork and becoming a better software engineer. Remind the students of their community-of-trust relationship.

When students describe their perception of the sprint, spot hollow phrases like: “your communications skills are fine”, or “I like to have you in my team” etc. Ask them to provide examples and ask the speaker to state how this impacts him or her. In doing so you create more confidentiality and trust. Moreover, you provide the team(members) with specific points for improvement.
 - *Smart goals for the next sprint.* Retrospectives are meetings to learn from. It is essential that the meeting leads to change-actions. Therefore, make sure that the students explicitly identify goals for the next sprint, both on personal level (e.g., regarding the students’ personal learning goals, communication behavior or task focus), and on team level (e.g., communication with the customer, task organization, quality measures, etc.).

Some goals are quantifiable (for instance, regarding the metrics gathered prior to the meeting), but this is not always the case. It is important though, that goals are formulated in a SMART (Specific Measurable Achievable Relevant Time-bound) way, so that students can revisit them in the next meeting and clearly find out if the goals were met.

Get back to these goals every next visit to the team. This way, they do not forget their goals, and they can see improvements very soon.
