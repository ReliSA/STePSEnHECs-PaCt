## Synopsis

Ideally, rooms on campus should be usable for different teaching and learning scenarios. Room-height curtain systems that can be used to separate smaller areas can support the flexible use of rooms.

## Context

The variety of methods and social forms, as well as the diverse use of digital media and tools, creates diverse requirements for the spaces on campus in which teaching and learning take place. In contrast to the huge variety of different didactic scenarios, Universities only possess a fixed number of different rooms. In addition, not all didactic settings are needed at the same time in most cases and having different rooms would lead to a situation in which not all of them could be fully utilized. Accordingly, there is a great need for flexible spaces that enable a variety of teaching-learning scenarios. Now, as described in the patterns [Flexible educational rooms](Flexible_educational_rooms.md) and [Flexible furniture](Flexible_Furniture.md), there are already solutions targeting the reusability or movability of equipment and furnishings, through which their flexible usage can be increased. But apart from the interior, there are also spatial requirements of the room itself, which can vary greatly and change quickly: sometimes one large room is needed, sometimes many small rooms.

## Problem

If necessary, a larger room should be divisible into several sub-areas for a short period of time during a teaching event. Particularly when dividing the room for work in several small groups, visual and sound protection are getting much more important, so that the groups do not disturb each other. This is hardly doable with a rearrangement of furniture, and even if it were possible, it would represent too high an effort.

## Forces

 - Alternating teaching/learning scenarios within a course: Courses often include different work phases within a single attendance session with an interplay of large group and smaller student groups.
 - Flexibility in room use: Classic seminar and work group rooms can be adapted to different usage scenarios in terms of their furnishings, but they usually do not offer visual and sound protection for work in small groups.
 - Flexible learning spaces and rooms: Students need learning spaces on campus where they can work undisturbed in different group sizes. Quiet zones for individual learning or breaks are also needed.
 - Hybrid teaching and learning scenarios: Hybrid teaching and learning settings often use video broadcasting or evenrecording. To ensure good image and sound quality as well as undisturbed communication of all participants, a noise-protected, if necessary sound-attenuated environment with privacy screen or neutral and quiet background and adaptable lighting conditions is required.
 - Project rooms and studios: Teachers and students can use studios and project rooms on campus where they have access to highquality technical equipment, e.g. to produce videos or podcasts, use VR environments or develop prototypes. Depending on the use, the requirements for the space differ in terms of size, lighting conditions or sound insulation. Studios in particular are sometimes very large, but - depending on the department - are not needed on a daily basis and therefore offer space for alternative use.

## Solution

Curtain systems allow a room to be quickly divided into smaller units. Running along the ceiling via a track system, the floor toceiling curtains act as "flexible walls" providing both visual and sound protection between the resulting room units and can be moved and adjusted entirely as required.

## Implementation 

### Details

Curtains made of high-quality, sound-absorbing materials can be used both to divide rooms into smaller units and to separate individual areas from large learning spaces. With an average ceiling height and smooth-running curtain rails, the curtains can be easily moved by hand. On the other hand, if the room is very high, an electric curtain system can be useful.

Curtain systems are suitable for flexibly dividing seminar rooms into smaller areas for group work at any time. In larger learning areas on campus, curtain systems can also be used to separate individual areas and use them, for example, as group work areas or as quiet zones. In studios and project rooms, the curtains can be used to set up areas for video production or separate areas for VR use, for example, as required.

To ensure that the room can actually be used flexibly, flexible furniture is required in addition to the curtain system. Seating and tables must be transportable and quickly and easily adaptable to different usage scenarios.

Another elementary requirement for the flexible use of digital media is a power supply in all room areas as well as connections for the room technology in the room units being created. Preference should be given to easily accessible, barrier-free connections in the floor or walls and, if necessary, connections that can be lowered from the ceiling (see Figure 1) and do not restrict freedom of movement in the room.

### Obstacles

If curtains are used to divide the room, this may result in room units without daylight. In addition, depending on the use of the curtains, the lighting conditions in the room change again and again. It is therefore necessary to have a well-designed lighting system that provides good illumination in all areas of the room and can be adapted to the way the room is used.

In addition to the curtain tracks, the ceiling may also need to be fitted with lighting and room technology, such as projectors, whereby the individual elements may get in each other’s way depending on their placement and may restrict each other’s usage options. Presentation areas or displays may also be provided on the walls, which should be accessible both when the curtains are drawn forward and when they are open. Accordingly, these room elements and their placement in the room should be coordinated with each other prior to installation and optimized for the room’s central usage scenarios in the event of competing needs.

Spatial conditions, such as the load-bearing capacity of the ceiling structure, but also safety regulations, for example regarding fire protection and materials used, can present hurdles for the installation of a curtain system. However, with good planning in advance, good solutions can usually be found for implementation. However, this can result in additional costs.

If a room is used by several groups of people at the same time, the use of the curtain system may interfere with other people’s use of the room. In this case, clear rules for the use of the room are helpful, in addition to a basically considerate cooperation.

## Consequences

 - (+) Space capacities or the existing areas on the campus can be used in different ways through curtain systems, providing a high flexibility in room use. Depending on requirements, open, semi-open or closed sub-areas can be created, making it also possible to alternate between teaching/learning scenarios within a course. In contrast to freely adjustable screening and soundproofing walls or permanently installed sliding walls, curtains can be used much more quickly and have a greater effect, which especially helps in hybrid teaching and learning scenarios. In addition, the room always looks tidy because there are no mobile movable walls standing around. Several people (groups) can use a room for different purposes at the same time, while mutual disturbances are reduced. The curtain systems can be used independently and quickly changed by all persons in the room. So students are able to create flexible learning spaces on their own as needed. Lighting conditions and room sound can be adjusted as needed, making it possible to quickly create and switch between different types of subspaces, such as project rooms and studios.
 - (-) The rail system on the ceiling gives different uses for the room partitioning, so flexibility in use is limited by predefined options. Emerging room units are not visible through the subdividing curtains. In order to see whether a room area is currently being used or to communicate with people present there, the corresponding area must be entered. This can be perceived as "bursting into the room" or as a disturbance. As flexible space elements, curtain systems are wearing items. High-quality materials can extend their life, but regular maintenance and replacement of system parts, if necessary, must still be planned for. High quality curtains are expensive.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - At the Technical University of Cologne, curtain systems are used on the Gummersbach campus to divide a large room into smaller subareas as required (see Figure 2). Supporting columns in the room were specifically integrated into the curtain system as partitioning elements.
 - At the Bauhaus University Weimar , a hybrid learning studio has been created as part of the Lernraum.Bauhaus project, in which prototypical hybrid teaching and learning situations are staged and tested, and technological solutions are tested regarding their practicality, usability and ease of use, as well as their didacticmethodological potential. A flexible curtain system allows the studio to be divided into sub-areas and represents an important aspect of the spatial concept, in which aesthetic and atmospheric aspects of the space in particular were taken into account as essential factors in the experience of use.
 - In the journal stacks of the University Library of Basel, a curtain system was installed to separate a quiet zone from a larger learning area with workstations. These and many other design solutions can be found in the open access publication "Learning Spaces Laboratory: New Learning Spaces at the University of Basel"[[SCH'23]](../References.md).
