# Flexible Educational Rooms

## [Category](categories/categories.md)

[Environment and Infrastructure](categories/Environment_and_Infrastructure.md)

## Synopsis

Rooms are flexible when they can be used well for different purposes. This is often accomplished by allowing for rapid changes of the furniture. The best case would be though, if a setup allows for multiple teaching or learning scenarios, without needing to rearrange the furniture at all. The design of the rooms should therefore take into account the primary functions, but also the secondary forms of use. For example, a seminar room can be designed for group discussion (primary function) and still allow for lectures or practical exercises (secondary form of use).

## Context

In the field of education, spaces suggest certain options for action and social forms. A classroom reduces the didactic possibilities to what it offers functionally. This means, that if the functional scope of individual rooms is very small, then many rooms, each with a specific functional scope, must be provided for different functions and educational purposes.

## Problem

Having multiple rooms requires swapping between them every time a new need arises. This often consumes too much time to be feasible, which results in using less optimal room settings as a compromise and therefore in a poorer teaching or learning quality.

## Forces

 - Seamless learning: Changes between teaching methods, social forms, activities and use of media should be smooth and avoid any seams. Each seam decreases the probability of changing between the appropriate setup.
 - Quality of learning: Spaces suggest certain forms of use. While it is true that even very poorly equipped spaces can be very successful in teaching and learning, and even in the best equipped space there can be poor teaching and ineffective learning, the likelihood of good teaching and learning increases with the appropriateness of the spaces.
 - Spaces as service providers: Spaces should be viewed as offering the services they can provide. In this context, different functions can be performed differently well in a space.
 - Pedagogical diversity: Teaching and learning can take on very different forms with rapidly changing needs, and rooms must provide different functions or services for this purpose. Within a room, different didactic methods as well as social forms must be able to seamlessly intertwine.
 - Rearrangement time: Different functions often require a redesign of the room, e.g. by flexible furniture. But this also takes time and often room users wonder if they are even allowed to do this.
 - Space Scarcity: There are always too few rooms on campus, as new needs and usage requirements are constantly being developed. It is hardly possible and would be quite uneconomical to provide a dedicated space for every purpose. On the other hand, "one size-fitsall" spaces or multi-purpose spaces are often not the most optimal solution.
 - Affordance: The room must also communicate what didactic possibilities it offers. On the one hand, the furniture design should suggest a natural way of using the space. On the other hand, every room also radiates a symbolic power and sends signals to the users as to what kind of teaching, learning and working is desired.
 - Fire protection and safety: When designing rooms, safety standards must be observed, which must not be disregarded by arbitrary rearrangement.

## Solution

Rooms should be designed in such a way that they are optimized for predefined forms of use but still sufficiently support unexpected and newly emerging didactic needs or options. Ideally, switching between forms of use is possible without redesigning the room. Different didactic methods as well as social forms must be able to seamlessly intertwine.

## Implementation 

### Details

Therefore, primary and secondary functions should be defined in space planning. For the primary functions (e.g. presentation, creative collaboration, joint learning, examination situations), the affordance should be optimized, i.e. the room suggests exactly these forms of use and also symbolizes them. Secondary functions (learning groups can also sit in the lecture hall, consultation or examination can also take place in the innovation room) should also be very well supported, even if the room is not optimized for them. Functions for which the room is not actually designed should nevertheless not be prevented if possible (a lecture hall is not well suited for group work, but if the lecture hall provides swiveling chairs and tables on one level, this is also possible).

Switching between forms of use should be possible without rearranging the room, if possible. But this naturally has its limitations. If tables, chairs, whiteboards or other furniture really need to be moved, then this should be done as quickly as possible (see [Flexible furniture](Flexible_Furniture.md) and [Flexible curtain systems](Flexible_Curtain_Systems)). This is because in complex didactic settings the change of a form of use takes place not only between events, but often also during the event. In larger rooms, space can be divided into different zones, e.g. one area for presentations and another area for group work. The room then offers different functions in different areas and allows for experimentation (see [Teaching-/Learning-experimentation rooms](Teaching-Learning_Experimentation_Rooms.md)).

### Obstacles

If furniture needs to be rearranged, a room plan should specify which options are possible. On the one hand, this can inspire, and on the other, prevent escape routes from being carelessly obstructed. Via QR code, the room plans can also be provided digitally and, if necessary, with instruction video.

With interactive displays or media carts, particular care must be taken to ensure that cables do not become trip hazards. Often, a display permanently installed on a particular wall is used more often than a mobile device. Students may move to the display faster than the display can be moved to the optimal location.

Traditional room types often suggest certain types of use, often from experiences in previous years of study. Posters with examples of room use can inspire alternative modes of use.

## Consequences

 - (+) Flexible and diverse use of spaces also supports a higher didactic diversity. Frequent change between didactic methods is promoted through a room that offers several possibilities. Rooms designed this way have a higher chance of providing the correct affordances and therefore a visible relationship between space and use. Concerning the space scarcity, less space is used,  which is usually the most limited resource. Additionally, following this approach usually results in lower costs than designing multiple rooms.
 - (-) Still more effort for using an optimal setup than if a room is directly optimized for an activity. The design process gets more complicated with each form of use that must be provided. Additional requirements like fire protection and safety further enhance the complexity and therefore often aren’t implemented as well as intended. Often a trade-off between perfect setup and flexible use must be chosen. This means, a single rooms with dedicated functional scopes will still be the better service providers for specific situations.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - A lecture hall with flexible room use was implemented at the University of Basel as part of a pilot project. The room supports both use as a lecture hall and group work. Two rows of seats in the room are placed on one level at a time. Students in the front row in each case can sit on swiveling chairs facing forward to the head side of the room or turn to face those seated behind them and thus work at a common table as a small group. An insight into the pilot project is provided by a field report on e-teaching.org and the publication "Learning Spaces Laboratory: New Learning Spaces at the University of Basel"[[SCH'23]](../References.md).
 - Similar room solutions are described in the "Cookbook Education Spaces" of the TU Delft. Here, too, large terraced rooms were equipped with rotating rows of chairs to support group work in addition to a classic use as a lecture hall.
