# Flexible Furniture

## Synopsis

Movable furniture enables the rapid reconfiguration of a room. This increases the functionality of the room (flexible educational rooms), enables more participation in the design of learning spaces (teaching-learning-experiment spaces) and seamless switching between different didactic settings.

## Context

As described in Flexible educational rooms, there is a need for flexible learning and teaching spaces because frequently, rooms are to be used for different tasks that require different didactic settings. This applies both to general learning rooms and to subject-related learning rooms that are assigned to a laboratory or institute. The patterns solution promoted to target multiple primary and secondary forms of use when designing such a room, while still focusing on a fixed arrangement of furniture. But such a fixed setup has its limitations regarding the number of supported functionalities and didactic options, no matter how many thoughts went into its design. At some point in time, rearranging the furniture will still be needed to match the didactic needs and therefore raise the quality of education.

## Problem

To allow flexible learning scenarios, different setups needs to be prepared, changed in between, and restored afterwards. However, rearranging furniture is often time consuming and not feasible because of limited teaching time. Instead of adapting to optimal learning setups, teachers and students stick to what they find in the built learning environment.

## Forces

 - One room for many pedagogical possibilities: Ideally, a room already offers flexible uses without the need for reconfiguration. But the more diverse the methods and activities in a room, the less one room configuration fits all.
 - Only what is necessary: A multipurpose room is often equipped with technologies and furniture that are not needed at all. These may distract or even give room users the wrong ideas.
 - Rapid change: While many pieces of furniture can be moved around, this takes up teaching time. If room setups need to be restored after using them, this costs additional time.
 - Experimentation: Lecturers and students like to try out different room configurations and discover the best constellation for their tasks.

## Solution

Rooms can be partially or fully equipped with mobile and modular furniture to allow quick reconfiguration before or during the event. The room can change during an event as teachers and students see fit, and offer more possibilities.

## Implementation 

### Details

Although tables and chairs can usually be moved very easily, special furniture with castors not only support the redesign, but also directly give "permission" to rebuild. In addition to tables and chairs, the following teaching and learning furniture is often part of flexible equipment:
 - Movable whiteboards
 - Media trolleys or mobile displays
 - Plug-in systems, e.g. seating cubes ("bleacher" systems)
 - Beanbags and small tables
 - Stackable chairs or stools
 - Trolleys with work materials
 - Flipcharts
 - Partition walls
 - Different attachments for tables or drawers with different work setups

It is important to distinguish between furniture that can be used in different ways (for example, a bench can be moved to a different location) and furniture that is moved regularly and deliberately. In the case of frequent rearrangement, it is important to ensure that this can be done quickly, easily and safely. In addition, components that are not required (e.g. several whiteboards) should take up as little space as possible and, if necessary, be stackable or nestable.

Good ergonomics is very important. Classic lecture halls or seminar rooms often use standard furniture that takes into account long-established standards (table or chair height). Funky, colorful and flexible furniture often looks good, but is not always comfortable. Therefore, furniture should definitely be tested at the supplier or at trade shows.

### Obstacles

Often mobile furniture is purchased, which then stands only in one place. If pieces of furniture are moved very rarely, then it is not necessary to pay attention to maximum mobility. If the room changes frequently and the furniture is moved, stability is an important criterion. In addition, no accidents should occur due to improper use (incorrect folding of tables).

When redesigning rooms, escape routes must be taken into account. Flexible furniture can increase accessibility, but sometimes it can also decrease it. Here, care must be taken to ensure that rooms are inclusive. The room should generally provide the necessary resources for students even when furniture is moved. For example, make sure that light and electricity are accessible to all.

## Consequences

 - (+) The room can be aligned with pedagogical requirements and purposefully redesigned depending on the desired function, resulting in a room for many pedagogical possibilities. The room’s form of use can be changed quickly, even for longer-term setups if, for example, the primary event form of a room changes every semester. Flexible furniture can also be moved quickly between rooms, allowing ad-hoc responses to changing participant numbers or new requirements. Expensive media technology, e.g. mobile interactive displays, can be used in several rooms. Through this flexibility, rooms can be reduced to only what is necessary for the current task. Moreover, fewer rooms are needed because they can be adjusted to the current needs, which solves a lot of problems related to space scarcity. However, care must be taken to ensure that room users also find reliability in the equipment.
 - (-) Flexible furniture is partly more expensive to purchase. The furnishings also never look their best because - unlike one off furnishings and fittings - time is not always taken to arrange the elements properly. Putting the furniture back so that the next course finds a tidy room again costs additional time.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - Figure 1 shows movable furniture at the Technical University of Cologne.
 - The University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) offers teachers and students flexible learning spaces equipped with movable furniture. Among other things, chairs with castors and integrated desk shelves are used, which can be placed anywhere in the room. An open work zone at the FHNW Campus Brugg-Windisch with modular wooden boxes, standing tables, etc. can be individually designed for group and project work. With the learning and teaching spaces, agile and project-oriented forms of teaching in particular, as well as other forms of collaborative and interactive learning and teaching, are to be spatially supported in an even more targeted manner.
 - The image from the Innovation Hub Bergisches Rheinland (Figure 2) shows how to enhance a classical seminar room with flexible furniture. Tables and chairs can be placed anywhere in the room on castors. The room equipment is supplemented by a mobile display and rollable flipcharts. Additionally, all the tables can be used as whiteboards, making their flexibility even more powerful.
 - Figure 3 presents furniture that can be flexibly adapted according to the modular building block principle, as used for example at the Technical University of Cologne. The furniture can be used individually as seating and small tables or combined with each other in different variants, e.g. as bleachers.
 - Whiteboards, pin boards and similar furniture do not necessarily have to be on wheels in the room for flexible use. Use in different areas of the room can also be made possible as shown by the PH Karlsruhe (Figure 4), who attached the interaction surfaces to the wall with a rail system. In this way, they can be moved as required in the short term. Individual elements can also be relocated on the rail system or even be detached and used independently if the room setup is to be changed in the medium to long term.
