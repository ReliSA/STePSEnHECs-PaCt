# Flipped Conference

## Context

Students should experience research-based learning. Research includes scientific discourse at conferences - with technical papers, networking, and lively discussions during coffee breaks and at the conference dinner.

## Problem

Attendance fees and travel costs exceed student budgets and are not fundable by the public purse for larger student groups. But without experiencing the participation in a research community they will only acquire knowledge instead of contributing to scientific research and discourse.

## Forces

 - Scientific Discourse: Scientific lectures and the presentation of current research results provide important impulses for a critical examination of one’s own discipline. However, students who are just socializing within a discipline often shy away from intensive participation. This is all the more true when they encounter closed, established, and often homogeneous research communities.
 - Proximity of time between presentation and discussion: Discourse should happen promptly, usually immediately following the presentation of research results - as well as during the question sections of conference sessions and coffee breaks. Conferences create free space for discussion and the initiation of new scientific contacts.
 - Special environment: Conferences create a special perceptual context. Participants escape the daily work routine and focus on research, development and the exchange of ideas. But students usually do not have the financial means to attend such events. Travel, hotel and conference fees exceed student budgets.
 - Online streams: Many conferences now stream a large portion of sessions for free attendance. But viewers of these streams are mostly passive and have no opportunity for eye-level interaction. In addition, they are "caught up" in their workday and are disturbed by other students or roommates.
 - Synchronization of participants: Conferences have a synchronizing function, meaning that many people with the same interests are in the same place at the same time. However, in live streams of conference sessions, viewers are often in different locations and have no opportunity for direct interaction. With asynchronous streams of recorded sessions, the shared experience falls even further apart.
 - Atmosphere: Conferences have a special atmosphere that invites the exchange of ideas. The program elements of a good conference have an inviting character to network with others. Professional exchange usually happens not only directly with the speakers at the end of a session, but much more often between audience members during the coffee break. This is especially true for keynotes that are meant to provoke and inspire.
 - What streams can’t do: Conferences are effective, create a focused space, intensify engagement with a topic area, and enable new ways of thinking through their atmosphere. While the lecture can be streamed technically, the informal encounters, as well as the smaller workshops, cannot be digitally broadcast.

## Solution

Organize a conference on campus in which the talks and presentations are streamed from a remote conference. This will create the typical atmosphere of a conference by streaming talks from the actual professional conference into lecture halls, followed by a locally moderated discussion. Coffee breaks will also be organized on campus between the lectures, and additional sessions could be held on campus for students to engage with conference topics in workshop sessions.

## Implementation 

### Details

The flipped conference can be organized independently of the official conference organizers. However, it is also possible to contact the organizers and announce yourself as an official conference satellite.

It is important to create the typical conference atmosphere on your campus. This can be achieved by
 - A mandatory registration (with a fee, if necessary, to pay for coffee and food).
 - Students wear name badges.
 - Organizing coffee breaks on campus between presentations. Use coffee tables as connection points for participants. Free drinks are available during breaks between presentations.
 - There is a conference planner with time and room schedules for the sessions.
 - Streaming of presentations from the actual conference into lecture halls, followed by locally moderated discussions between participating students.

You can also run additional sessions on campus in which students engage with topics from the conference in workshop sessions.

The conference event must not clash with regular classes. It is important to create a protected time period that is clearly different from the daily campus routine.

For the professional discourse, it is important that academic staff and lecturers participate in the conference in addition to students. This creates informal contacts and transfers the familiarity of a conference to the campus

### Obstacles

 - The conference should be directly related to curricular issues.
 - The local organization must have participatory elements and ensure that students have a special experience and stay with it throughout the conference - otherwise the conference will be a dud. There must be a "coolness factor"; this can be achieved through special frameworks such as free catering, informal contact with professors or playful program elements.
 - Rooms on campus must be reserved. During the lecture period, this requires a great deal of organization. Conferences that take place during the non-lecture period are therefore ideal. However, the conference can also be held in a single room if only individual lectures are broadcast.

## Consequences

 - (+) Students experience the scientific discourse of a conference without the time and expense of traveling to a conference.
 - (+) Access to conferences whose number of participants is limited is made possible. In particular, high-profile conferences whose on-site attendance is particularly exclusive seek to become more inclusive by offering free streaming.
 - (+) The satellite’s flanking events can be adapted to the teaching and research topics of one’s own campus.
 - (+) Reflection, participation, and presentation of one’s own project results can take place during the conference, leading to exam credit.
 - (+) A satellite conference can also take place at a later time, e.g. after lecture and examination times, thus making use of campus facilities.
 - (+) Compared to the travel costs for a larger group of students, the costs of organizing a local conference satellite are manageable.
 - (-) Students can get used to the hybrid format and then later do not attend conferences on site at all.
 - (-) Attending a hybrid conference is a heavy time commitment for students, which can conflict with class or exam schedules, deadlines, and study periods.
 - (-) Students get the wrong impression of conferences if the right atmosphere is not created on campus. This could then be more of a deterrent.
 - (-) Commitment is lower at a hybrid conference. Students may not be there for the entire conference, so they may consume the presentations but not engage in deeper technical discussion.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - In the field of software development, large developer conferences have become established. Star developers present the latest hacks, libraries and methods. Participation in these professional conferences (e.g. Kotlin Conference, Apple Developer Conference) is limited and expensive. However, many interested people watch individual presentations anyway. Through a conference satellite, interested parties can exchange ideas on-site and create a "we-feeling". On the computer science campus of the TH Köln, for example, research staff regularly gather to watch the Apple Developer Conference together. Before the pandemic, a companion conference to the Kotlin Conf was planned - with a pizza event.
 - At the Kotlin conference, there is a "Kotlin Puzzlers" session where attendees are presented with programming puzzles on the spot ("How does this code behave?"). Students can also participate in these puzzles during a satellite.
 - The annual Digital Life Design conference brings the IT elite from Silicon Valley to Munich every January. But it costs several thousand euros to attend and you have to apply for tickets. On the other hand, many lectures and panels are streamed and can thus be used in a satellite.
