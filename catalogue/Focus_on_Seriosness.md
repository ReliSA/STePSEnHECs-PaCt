## Context

## Problem

Working in a group can be fun and the atmosphere is often informal. But if it only stays informal then there is a chance that the members do not sufficiently work on the assignment.

## Forces

## Solution

Make sure that it is clear for all group members that things have to be taken seriously in order to make things happen.
