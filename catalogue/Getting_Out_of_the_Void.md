## Context

You want to engage with the students thought the virtual tooling.

## Problem

It can be very hard to interact with an online class. Many students sign in to the class session and do not do anything after that. They do not turn on the microphone or the camera. This makes teaching harder. You don’t know if they are tuned in, if the teaching is understood, or if they walked away.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, design the sessions to have parts with verbal interaction, and share with your students the benefits of the teacher having visual contact with the students. Be honest about your own need for non-verbal feedback and how difficult it is to teach to a black screen. Tools like Zoom, CISCOWebEx, and Blackboard tools offers built it collaboration functionality to simulate the interaction in the classroom. In order for this to work effectively every student should have the camera and microphone on, but you will need to accept that some students are reluctant to do so and that they may be in environments (like at home with their family present) where the use of two-way media is not feasible. Utilizing the break out rooms creates a different atmosphere causing students to turn on microphones and cameras as they know the teacher is not in the room. It is also a smaller setting. Some students are fearful when speaking in a full class. Including teacher free parts can help make students more comfortable with having their cameras and microphones on. For the teacher to no longer feel they are talking to the void you need some engaged students, not the full class.

Figure 1: Getting Out of the Void

> "There are lots of valid reasons for students to keep their cameras off during class ... but all the cameras off can sometimes make it feel like you’re standing at the edge of the wing of a spaceship looking out into the endless void of space. Some teachers lose their chill in that moment." - Zachary Kuhn, English Teacher
