## Context

## Problem

If things go wrong, but are not addressed in the group, then the chance that things improve is small. But giving and receiving feedback is difficult and group members are possibly afraid of giving feedback or do not handle it in a good way.

## Forces

## Solution

Give feedback in a constructive way, ideally in the form of suggestions for improvement. Do not immediately start to defend yourself if you are criticized, but try to be open for the feedback and suggestions for improvement.
