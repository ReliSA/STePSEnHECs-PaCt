# Grip on the assignment

## Context

In getting a grip on the assignment, students need help with a balancing act: getting specific enough to be able to start with the project and learning to deal with the uncertainty that comes with the start of any project.

In the meantime, the direction of the assignment matters to the teacher as well. The better you understand it, the better you can guide them, and the better you can assess if the assignment will help to meet the desired learning outcomes. You depend mainly on indirect communication with the customer. The noisy environment as sketched in Figure 2 becomes even more noisy

## Problem

So, the problem is: As a teacher, how do you guide students during the initial phase of the project, without doing the work yourself and while preventing cognitive overload and assuring the level of the assignment regarding the required learning outcomes.

## Forces

 - ***Students are bad at deciding which direction for their project might be promising.*** They easily choose directions they already know instead of investigating what is appropriate in the given situation.
 - ***Students do not have market experience; they cannot easily identify with the context and problems of the customer.*** Combined with a lack of strategies for systematic requirements elicitation this leads to unspecific and therefore poorly understood use cases.
 - ***Students tend to overestimate the knowledge and skills of the person describing the assignment*** (aka the problem addressed in the project); they often take everything said for granted. This, again, leads to unspecific and poorly understood use cases.
 - ***As a teacher, you often guide students in problem and solution domains unknown to you.*** You need to get to know this domain as soon as possible, and without having direct contact with the customer.
 - ***Customers tend to be too indulgent with students, which compromises the learning situation.*** They easily drop requirements that are necessary for the students to reach the required learning outcomes.

## Solution

Structure the project in a way that students can get a grip on the assignment and at the same time get deeply involved. This can be achieved by distinguishing an on-boarding phase, on-the job guiding and finally a reflection phase.

In guiding them you act a bit like a relationship coach: you reflect on the student’s relation to the customer and help them do the right things by reflecting on their process. Note that your guidance aims at getting the group on track. Of course, on the way, you will notice individual differences between students, but in this stage of the project these differences are not of interest.

<ul>
    <li><i>Onboarding the first meeting with the customer.</i> In helping students onboarding we take four steps: reference book, preparing the meeting, requirements engineering skills and mindset. 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Step 1: preparing the meeting:</b> The problem of ineffective communication skills in this phase concentrates on preparing the meeting. Tell the students: 
        <ul>
            <li>The primary goal of the first customer meeting: to get all information and requirements needed so that they can work independently for the first iteration 
            </li>
            <li>To prepare a meeting agenda to make sure they all take an active role in the meeting 
            </li>
            <li>To send an agenda, including specific questions they want to pose, to the product owner in advance. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 2: requirements engineering skills:</b> Although students have some requirements engineering experience, you must remind them how it works. You could help them by posing questions like: 
        <ul>
            <li>Who is going to use the application when it is finished? 
            </li>
            <li>What might be the goal of the product owner? 
            </li>
            <li>What final product does the product owner envision? 
            </li>
            <li>What is the problem domain? What are the important concepts in this domain? 
            </li>
            <li>What might be the high-level use-cases? 
            </li>
            <li>Can you think of constraints already? 
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 3: mindset:</b> Because it is difficult for students to separate the important from the irrelevant, stress that knowing what you do not know helps finding out what is important to you and therefore helps you prepare the meeting with the customer. Let them write down their assumptions and questions prior to the meeting with the customer and provide feedback from your own professional experience. 
    </ul>
    </li>
    </li>
    <li><i>On-the-job guiding during the first meetings with the customer.</i> Agree with the team to divide the first meeting with the customer into two sessions with a break in between. The break is meant for you to guide the students in case they missed important aspects or forgot something, or in case their communication skills left them stuck in the conversation. Although there is no time to do things twice, the second meeting will give them much more grip on the assignment. 
    <ul>
        <li><b>First Session: get grip.</b> Your goal in the first session is to get a grip on the problem/solution domain, the assignment, and the team yourself, just by observing. Be a ‘fly on the wall’; do not interact with the team or the customer at all. Be patient. It can be a clever idea to face a wall instead of the group of people, so you are not being seen as a communication partner. While doing so: 
        <ul>
            <li>Pay attention to the phenomenon of positive and negative undercurrents in the conversation. When did it occur, what was the cause, how did it affect the purpose of the meeting, how did the students deal with it? 
            </li>
            <li>Think along with the students, is the situation clear to you? What additional questions would you ask? Could there be misunderstandings between the customer and the students? 
            </li>
            <li>Take notes so you can compare them to the students’ notes in the reflection

If you are not able to attend the first meeting in person, consider attending online while the team and customer meet in real life. Or let them record the meeting. In any way let them report back to you before there second session takes place. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>During the break: better communication.</b> Your focus during the break is on providing the team better communication and systematic elicitation strategies to get things clear enough to move on with the project: 
        <ul>
            <li>Ask the students if they feel they have met the purpose of their first meeting, and why so. Share your observations: when and why did they do well, what were key moments that should be improved next time 
            </li>
            <li>Ask the students to explain their idea of the problem domain and -if possible- compare it to your own picture. Ask critical questions to make them aware of knowledge and information gaps, but do not fill in the blanks yourself 
            </li>
            <li>Ask the students to make visual sketches of the problem at hand. Noting things down forces students to be more specific 
            </li>
            <li>Walk through the catalog of questions and assumptions created during the onboarding; can they answer all questions now, are all aspects noted down? Which questions need to be answered after the break? 
            </li>
            <li>Let them agree on their roles in the second session. Suggest that one person be a ‘sketcher’ who sketches use cases and domain concepts on a whiteboard during the meeting 
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Second session: clarifying.</b> Join the group as an active member in the second session, but let students stay in the lead to clarify remaining questions. If the students leave gaps open, this time you intervene by asking through, clarifying your own remaining questions, and verifying assumptions; now you act as a role model for them to learn from 
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><i>Reflection.</i> The day after the second session, let them sketch the situation for you, as they understand it now. Let them iterate with the customer if you have the impression that they still did not get the idea. 
    </li>
</ul>
Above all: given the information you have now, assess if you think the assignment will enable the students to achieve the learning outcomes. If in doubt: contact the customer. Talk about what is necessary and how this can be reflected in the assignment. You do not need to bother the team about this.
