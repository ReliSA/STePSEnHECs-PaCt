## Context

You have students who are falling behind and not engaging with you or the class.

## Problem

There may be several reasons why a student is not engaged. It can be mundane reasons like taking on too many classes or juggling work and education in parallel. It can be technical problems with connectivity. But is can also be personal issues like poor confidence and social anxiety. To help the student you need to be able to investigate the problem. Unless you are a trained professional you need to be careful with how you intervene.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, make it clear at the beginning of the semester that you will treat your students as grownups responsible for their own life, and that your role is that of a educator and not a parent. If students are falling behind, reach out and do what is in your means to understand the problem. Get their motivation for taking the class and discuss with them what they what they need to fully participate. Maybe they need some extra help, maybe the personal attention is enough, maybe a change of [Class Buddy](Class_Buddy.md)? But also keep in mind that there will be students that you cannot help. You need to accept that some students will fail. Maybe they will realize that they need to act as a grownup, and this was a wakeup call. Or they were not ready for this class or online learning anyway and nothing you can do will resolve that. If you suspect or know that the student needs help for mental issues you can alert the college administration and show compassion with the student, but bottom line you need to free yourself from any guilt.

Figure 1: Grown Up Student

> "No matter how charismatic and engaging we are, how much technology we leverage, how many classes we flip or how many pallets of rubrics we deploy, in the end, it’s still the students who have to do the learning. We may be able to make it easier to learn, cheaper to learn or more fun to learn, but students will still have to do the work." - Eric Gilbert, Arkansas State University
