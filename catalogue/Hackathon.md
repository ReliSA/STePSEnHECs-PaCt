## Context

Students should develop solutions with high practical relevance and use new technologies. The possibilities of these technologies are often not yet known and have to be explored. Exploring the possibilities of a new technology often takes a lot of time and requires assistance from experts. In computer science the exploration of new technologies and their interfaces is quite common. However, other domains can also benefit from exploring the use cases of new technology.

## Problem

In everyday study life, there is hardly any freedom to deal intensively with innovative technologies and solution approaches because a strict schedule splits the attention of students on many different topics. In addition, unfamiliar technologies can often have their pitfalls and quickly lead to frustration. There is often not enough time to explore new technologies deeply.

## Forces

 - Exploration: New technologies always offer a wide range of possibilities that go far beyond the originally envisioned application potential of the providers. However, these possibilities are unknown and have yet to be discovered.
 - Lack of Documentation: New products, technologies and societal challenges are often poorly documented and require close interaction with others - both experts and other students and faculty who can provide guidance.
 - Synchronization: When exploring new technologies or developing innovative solutions, it is necessary to get in touch with experts in the field to ask questions or have principles explained. However, the time available to these experts is usually very limited.
 - Feedback: When new ideas, concepts and solutions are developed, early feedback is important so that corrections can be made.
 - Social learning: In the group, peers can learn from each other and copy skills from each other.
 - Flow: It is important to deal with the possibilities of a technology for a long time and without interruption. The psychological state of flow should not be disturbed by interruptions.
 - Skill levels and variations: Students have different skill levels and show interest in various fields. To work on complex solutions, students from different domains should work together in an interdisciplinary way.

## Solution

Organize an event that gives several teams the time to experiment with new technologies and develop prototype solutions and concepts. In this context, a hackathon is a continuous stretch of time, e.g., three days or a week, where a development task is covered in one piece, like a marathon. This development sprint is used to explore the possibilities of a technology in an exploratory manner and to discover the most diverse (alternative to the previously known) possible applications (i.e., to develop hacks).

## Implementation 

### Details

Hackathons have their origins in the software development environment and are therefore often used to explore new programming languages, hardware or platforms. For example, when a new piece of hardware comes to market (such as kits for the Internet of Things, interactive tables, augmented reality), hackathons provide an opportunity to draw on the many potentials and demonstrate what is possible. This is often not about developing a finished product but rather a "proof of concept," showing and proving that something is possible in principle.

At a hackathon, several teams work simultaneously on different solution ideas over a defined period of time. In the process, the teams can look over each other’s shoulders and inspire each other. Developers can learn tricks from each other. Often the development happens until deep in the night to take advantage of the flow, i.e. the very focused and dedicated work. Catering often happens right inside the hackahton rooms and often consists of pizza and other junk food, though more modern versions tend to focus on superfoods.

As a facilitator of hackathons you can support the team by providing advice on collaboration: finding out what the skills of each team member are, suggesting the next steps, or making a plan with milestones and a todo-list. However, you should not over-structure the event.

Hackathons are now used not only to explore technologies, but also to quickly develop proposed solutions to specific issues. These can be social issues, for example, when a hackathon is held to develop different apps for a disease, or apps for more civic participation.

Under the topic "Hacking Education", for example, new scenarios can be developed together with students on how technologies can be used in university teaching. It is noticeable that different technical competencies are required for the development of new solutions, e.g. programming knowledge, hardware knowledge or simply knowledge of products and software. This must be taken into account when planning hackathons.

When running a hackathon, the development goal is first presented. If the goal is to introduce new technologies, then expert lectures can first provide insight into the possibilities. This offers the option of integrating classic lecture parts into a hackathon but also to win external partners for impulses. In the case of thematic hackathons, the problems and requirements can also be explained in lectures. Nevertheless, a hackathon is characterized by practical implementation and testing. The majority of the time is therefore characterized by practical work, i.e. it is project work. Due to the iterative approach and the rapid development of prototypical solutions, design thinking methods and tools are increasingly incorporated into hackathons: students first explore the problem area, then focus on a task, develop creative ideas, and then implement them prototypically. In this respect, some hackathons are more like design sprints. Care should be taken to ensure that the process is not overly formalized. The playful character should be maintained.

In addition to reserving space for a longer period of time, catering should also be taken into account when planning. The participants should be able to work in one piece and be fully absorbed in the task at hand. Sponsorship models in which industry partners assume the catering costs are an option here.

### Obstacles

The atmosphere during a hackathon should remain informal; there should be a spirit of optimism. Overly formal processes and structured plans can be detrimental to a hackathon. At the same time, in an educational context, it should be ensured that certain learning objectives are also achieved.

The time during a hackathon should be blocked and not fragmented by external events or other events. In the sense of a marathon, a fairly long distance should be covered in one piece. Similar to a "runners high," there should be many happy moments during the hackathon, despite all the effort and exhaustion, as problems are solved and puzzles are cracked.

Hackathons rely on the curiosity and intrinsic motivation of the participants. Therefore, they are more suitable for elective courses. They can be challenging to count for credit, as hackathons often do not have the required amount of time. Strictly speaking, only 1 credit point would be eligible for participation in a one-week hackathon. Therefore, it is necessary to link the hackathon with further learning activities, e.g. technical preparation or the detailed elaboration afterwards.

The role of the lecturer has to be questioned. Are lecturers participants at eye level, advisors or rather teachers? Is it possible to dispense with the usual formalisms during the hackathon?

## Consequences

 - (+) Students learn in a competence-oriented way.
 - (+) Intrinsic motivation is unleashed.
 - (+) Feedback and assistance can be given directly.
 - (+) Teamwork and social exchange are encouraged, hackathons focus on collaboration.
 - (+) Real-world problems are tackled.
 - (+) Exploration of technology is encouraged to identify solution options.
 - (-) The event is very time-consuming to organize.
 - (-) Success depends on student motivation. If a hackathon is seen as a duty, this contradicts the goal of free development opportunities. The evaluation of the work results is correspondingly difficult.
 - (-) Integration into the curriculum is often not easy - both in terms of scheduling and credit points.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - “Education hackathon”: during a 1-week-sprint students of Computer Science and Media Pedagogy worked together to explore new setups for digital learning. They used the design thinking phase to explore the problem space, ideate and prototype. Models were created with Lego bricks and drawings.
 - To explore a new technology, a project week can be used at the Computer Science campus of TH Köln. This week can be used to explore the APIs of online services (such as Miro or Zoom), as well as hardware such as interactive table tops or maker toolkits (such as Little Bits, Blinks, or Fischertechnik).
 - Industry problems are proposed in hackathons run by the Innovation Hub BergischesRheinland. Partner companies propose a technology topic and students explore solutions for this domain.
