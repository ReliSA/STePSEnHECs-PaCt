# Hands On First

## [Facets](facets/facets.md)

[Category](facets/categories/categories.md): [Supplementary Learning](facets/categories/Supplementary_Learning.md)

## Context

As part of a coding workshop, the educators’ main goal is to keep participants motivated and engaged. At the same time, participants should get hands-on experience about the learned concepts. When planning the sequence of a workshop, educators consider different established approaches.

## Problem

The traditional design includes an initial theoretical input, with hands-on practice later on. This workshop design reduces the motivation of the participants, as they have to wait to work independently [[DIL'16]](../References.md). This can lead to a decrease in the participant’s commitment to the workshop.

## Forces

 - **Target Group:** Especially with a younger target group, it is important to pick them up early, as they lose motivation more quickly due to a shorter attention span. The reduced motivation further exacerbates their already limited attention span, compounding the challenge of maintaining active participation.
 - **Motivation:** The motivation of the participants is crucial for the success and the execution of the workshop.
 - **Early Impression:** During a workshop, the focus is on the initial introductory part as it is largely responsible for the success and atmosphere within the workshop and therefore a priority.
 - **Complexity:** When teaching complex topics, some prior knowledge may be required.
 - **Redundancies:** Depending on the prior knowledge of the participants, a frontal input can contain redundancies and thus reduce the motivation of some participants to a greater extent.
 - **Learning Preferences:** Different participants have different preferences in terms of how knowledge should be conveyed. Although those preferences don’t impact the actual learning process, they can influence participants’ motivation.
 - **Interaction:** Frontal input only allows very limited interaction for the participants.

## Solution

*Introduce an initial practical part as the starting point of the workshop.*

Instead of a frontal input as an introduction, the workshop should start with a practical part. This practical phase focuses on the interactive examination of the given topic. The teacher should allow the interactive exploration of the topic and act as support for learners if problems or barriers occur. This approach is also supported by the learning orientation  constructivism”, which describes learning as the process of learners actively constructing knowledge. The learner is an active participant in the process and requires engagement [[SZA'22]](../References.md).

As this solution describes an initial hands-on part, the example from the Code without Code pattern can be applied here. In the context of learning basic algorithms, participants can freely experiment with the existing building blocks to get a first understanding of a new topic. Afterward, further explanation should be provided by the workshop leader. For this running example, it is important to note that the solution of Hands-on first is not only restricted to get hands-on with physical objects but can also allow for an initial exploration in code.

## Consequences

 - (+) An initial practical part allows the workshop leader to get a **first impression** of the participants’ cognitive level and prior knowledge to adjust the workshop accordingly.
 - (+) Exploring a topic independently supports **individual learning speeds**.
 - (+) Going hands-on with a topic **increases** the participant’s **motivation**, especially with a younger target group.
 - (+) For the following parts of the workshop, participants can **fall back on** their **practical experience**, which can lead to a sense of achievement and positive emotions.
 - (+) An initial Hands-On part with optional guidance by an educator supports **experience-based learning**.
 - (+) A practical introduction can be used to convey a new topic, but also to sum up and **recollect prior knowledge**.
 - (-) **Depending on the topic and prior knowledge**, a practical introduction might not be possible.
 - (-) Working independently **requires** some amount of **prior knowledge**.
 - (-) A practical part at the beginning can set **false expectations** for the rest of the workshop.
 - (-) Additional **preparation** from the workshop supervisor is required.
 - (-) Learners might be **too shy to ask** the workshop leader for support.
 - (-) For some participants, an initial practical part might be **less fun** and therefore hinder their motivation.

|--|--|--|
|First Steep[[IBA'09]](../References.md)|supports solution|First Steep supports the idea of straight jumping into an interesting sounding topic and following your intuition alongside. This idea aligns with the solution of Hands-on first, which supports the exploratory introduction into a new topic.|
|Prototyping [[IBA'11]](../References.md)|potential enabler|Prototyping your ideas, can support the aspect of exploring a new topic. Participants can therefore validate or iterate their ideas.|
|Students Decide [[ECK'02]](../References.md)|potential enabler|Students Decide supports the idea of student leading the topic of a class, based on their interests and expectations. This can also be applied to the structure of a Coding Workshop.|
 
## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - The ”Hour of Code” is an international initiative to promote computer science in an educational context. Specifically, it is a concept that provides various activities and learning videos to give learners of all levels an insight into programming within one hour. Hour of Code includes an extensive collection of different learning resources and tasks, which can be used by interested teachers after registering for an event. Thanks to the community-driven approach, this collection is regularly expanded. Hour of Code is already used by over 400 partners and over 20,000 teachers. Figure 1 shows an exemplary overview of some activities on offer.[^1]
 - The ”Hour of Code” initiative aligns with the ”hands-on first” approach by providing learners with interactive activities, tasks and learning videos aimed at demystifying computer programming concepts within a short timeframe. This approach emphasizes active engagement and practical exploration, allowing learners to dive into coding concepts quickly and experiment with real code examples.
