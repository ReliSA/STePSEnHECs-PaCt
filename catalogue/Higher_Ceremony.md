## Context

## Problem

Though the  projects' smaller scale might would not call for it in industry, we need the students to try out and learn all the standard practices and produce evidence of it (paper trail) even if they can seem like an overkill.

## Forces

## Solution

**Explain this dilemma and the educational reasons for the level of ceremony to the students openly and clearly. Set the process to necessitate the taught practices and tools to a sufficient but not extremely overwhelming degree.**
