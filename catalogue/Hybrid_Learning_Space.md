## Synopsis

The dichotomy of digital and non-digital artefacts is resolved in a hybrid learning space by seamlessly bridging different types of artifacts, making digital data touchable and graspable, enhancing physical objects with digital information and digitizing physical objects.

## Context

We live in the real physical world, digital and connected devices are ubiquitous. Very often both worlds exist in their own space, and are only superficially interrelated. Things we can sense, feel, touch, see and hear are more meaningful to us. We like to tinker with real things. Very often we either work in the physical world only or in the digital world only.

## Problem

Working in the physical world limits the way of sharing and manipulating objects – the digital has much more to offer. However, the digital world limits the richness of interactions to a predefined set. Moreover, the digital world lacks the embodiment of actions, such as playing and tinkering with objects physically with your hands or other body parts, and arranging them spatially in a natural way.

## Forces

 - Interaction with objects is easier when they are real and tangible (see [INTERACTIVE TANGIBLE OBJECTS](../../../Interactive_Tangible_Objects.md)).
 - Digital objects can be easily manipulated, edited, shared and distributed.
 - Objects of the real world often can be represented as virtual objects; for example, a sticky-note can be a real piece of paper or a virtual object.
 - Physical object of our world can be augmented with additional information and functions using digital tools.
 - The mode of optimal representation depends on what you want to do with the object. Do you want to touch it? Move it in real physical space? Or do you want to share it across remote locations and work on it with remote participants? Very often both is needed.

## Solution

Therefore, merge both physical and virtual space into one hybrid space where real world objects can be digitized and represented in virtual space, and the digital space can be brought into the real world using tangible objects and devices.

## Implementation 

Both the physical and digital worlds have their own strengths and weaknesses. To empower the best of both we need to enrich both worlds with each other seamlessly. Every smartphone is capable of digitizing physical objects by simply making a photo. Special apps can support the extraction of meaningful information: identifying single sticky notes, mapping whiteboards to images, recognizing objects and gestures. Document cameras can quickly scan 2D-documents and 3D objects and send them to digital work spaces. Objects of the real world can also trigger the display of meaningful digital information. For example, a QR code or a specific layout on book pages or playing cards can start-up programs or blend in additional information. This additional information can appear on the smartphone screen as augmented reality, or on additional screens. On the other hand, the information of the digital world can be projected into the real world. Each smartphone becomes a window to the digital world. Projectors can display information on walls and even on objects. Physical objects can be enriched with small displays or other outputs such as audio and motion, based on digital processes. Objects in the real world are always at hand, you don’t have to turn on a computer to manipulate them, and many actions are more natural in the real world. For example, feeling the surface and weight of objects gives you direct clues how to hand and work with them. Setting up new arrangements is fast, straight-forward and requires no training. Writing and drawing on paper still provides a richer experience than most digital tools offer. The interaction of surface properties, pen type, layers of color etc. is still a richer experience.

## Consequences

 - (+) The real and digital worlds merge. Benefits of the digital world are mapped to real world objects. Real world objects can be represented seamlessly in the digital world, thus making sharing and manipulation easier. Information can be mapped to real world objects, allowing rich learning experiences. Tinkering with objects – real and digital – is encouraged and creative learning is more likely to happen.
 - (-) To make the transfer between both worlds seamless, a lot of hardware and software is needed. Thus, the experience is often bound to special rooms. It requires a lot of knowledge about methods and technology to unleash the full potential. While playing with things is a good and encouraging experience, it can also lead to using the technology for the sake of using technology.
