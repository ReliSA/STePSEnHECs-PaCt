## Context

Grading project work is a difficult process, and grading individuals within teams is even more complicated. Although much group work is involved in their studies, students have to prove that the are up for the task individually. This means that the teachers must grade them individually. As soon as the students have handed in their work, the teachers start grading. As the nature of their work depends on the assignment and the process the group and the individuals went through, a check model with the right answers is not available. There is lots of work to do, and time is limited, so the teacher withdraws to a quiet place and sets off to get through the pile in an optimistic mood. They are planning to get the job done swiftly, but they know at any moment they will get disappointed, and will start doubting "what did I do wrong that they delivered this!?".

## Problem

How to grade every single student in a group project in a reasonable amount of time, and stay confident during the process?

## Forces

 - **Being aware that failing a project might have large consequences for students.** As there are many ECTS at stake, the teacher is very keen on rewarding ’the right’ grade. They are very careful not to let someone fail unjustly as the students who have to redo the project will only be able to graduate at least 3 months later. This awareness stimulates overlooking the work again and again.
 - **Teacher fears discussion with students about the fairness of their observations after having published the grades.** This is another reason to keep on gathering extra information and new examples, even if the teacher has been giving enough hints and tips during the project phase. Actually this fear does not lead to grading, but to preparing a defence paper. Of course students could benefit from this as there is a lot of feedback available then. But at the end of term the teacher and students have to focus on next term, and not many students seem to be interested in extensive feedback at that time.
 - **Heavy work load.** Very often the teacher has to do more grading than only one or two groups in the same short period of time. If so, making too long hours is a real existing danger.
 - **Loosing openness.** Because the teacher guided the team during the project, they may be afraid that they lost their objectivity. Or, the other way around the team may have lost its openness to show failures as they might have thought that would have a direct effect on their grades.
 - **Diverse project teams.** If a team consists of students with a diverse background in terms of knowledge and skills, it is even more important to grade individually as the differences within the team can be big.
 - **Grading strategy changes over time.** If the first student performed very well, teachers tend to be more strict for the next to come. And the other way around. When the teacher is aware of this effect, it is attracting to grade again, to be sure that everybody was held to exactly the same standard.
 - **Getting exhausted.** If a teacher makes long hours to finish the pile of work, they can fall prey to exhaustion. This might result in getting annoyed by seeing the same mistakes over and over again, by finding out the student did not make use of feedback the teacher provided earlier, or by no longer being able to set aside any prejudices they have against certain students.

## Solution

This solution consists of guidelines which should be adapted throughout the whole grading process.
 - **"If every single student in a team performs just as good as the others in terms of quantity and quality, it would be logical and fair to reward the group grade to every student".** This statement needs to be top of mind during all grading activities as it prevents the teacher form diving too deep into details. Moreover it explains why a group grade is necessary to establish, even when does not have to be formally registered as such. In the end you only aim for an individual grade.
 - **Focus on the the deviations.** With the above statement in mind, the teachers ’just’ need to look for deviations from the average performance as expressed in the group grade. If a student performs better an upgrade is justified, if worse it has to be a downgrade.
 - **Holistic up and downgrades.** If every input a student produces over the course of an 8 weeks project needs to be graded, we will inevitably end up with a time-consuming, not very transparent, analytical grading process. Therefore up or down grades are not grounded in a strict analytical system. If the teacher thinks student A earns a reward because they did most of the difficult work, just reward them 0,5 or 1 point extra. The same goes for the other way round: if the student contributed enough, but invariably under average, their reward could be 0,5 or 1,0 points less than the group grade. As you keep it holistic, it is very well possible that a student fails the project even if the group work was rewarded with a pass. If a down grade is necessary, your first question therefore is: was their work sufficient enough anyway? If not, there is no relation with the group grade at all: the student will fail the project.
 - **Think of meeting this student next year.** If you are not sure if a student should pass at all, think of what you would be thinking if you meet this student again next year. Would they be able enough then, or would you think "how on earth did they get this far without being able to do/know X or Y..."
 - **Grading is teamwork** Grading project work should not be a solo activity. There simply are too much ECTS at stake. Therefore set up a process together with your colleague(s), in which individual preparation of every teacher is validated actively. In this way the grade becomes the teacher team’s grade, instead of an individual teacher’s grade. In the end for every deviation the teachers must be able to say: "On learning outcome number X you performed above/under average, that is why we rewarded you an/no extra point". See [2+2 makes four eyes- Grading individuals is teamwork](2_2_makes_four_eyes.md).
- **Guide and grade more than one group.** In the ideal situation a teacher has more than one group to grade. This enables comparison, which contributes to confidence. Even if the same teachers are involved, and even if they say an do exactly the same, the results will be different. This effect enables the teacher to objectify their experience.

## Consequences

 - (+) Because the individual grades are relative to the group grade, it is not necessary to have decided on the group grade beforehand. You could choose the working order.
 - (+) As the teachers work together, calibration takes place. Both in terms of ’what do we think is important to look at?’ and in terms of ’how to divide the work?’. This will certainly pay off when a teacher guides a next project team and when the same teacher team works together in a next project.
 - (+) If you start doubting too much, you know who can help you out. There is no need to get stuck completely.
 - (-) If you stay focused, this process takes minimal time. But is is still easy to get distracted, and still spend more time than you would actually need.
