## Context

## Problem

Often a group assignment is finished with a final presentation, which also counts for the grade. If this presentation — or parts of it — are given by someone which is not good in presenting, the grade for the whole group could be influenced negatively.

## Forces

## Solution

Let group members which are not that good with presentations practice it or provide them with a proven presentation process.
