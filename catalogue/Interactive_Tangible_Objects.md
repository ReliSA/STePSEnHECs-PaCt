## Synopsis

Make tangible objects connect to the virtual world. A tangible object can trigger digital actions, e.g. opening a web site or digital worksheet.

## Context

There needs to be control over the content of the digital world.

## Problem

Standard input devices (mice, keyboards, cameras) do not bridge the dichotomy between the real world and digital world artefacts because they provide very narrow interfaces for specialized tasks, such as typing, moving a mouse pointer or adding pictures.

## Forces

 - Real world objects are more real than virtual objects.
 - People like to play with things.
 - Touch is important.
 - Haptic feedback is rich.
 
## Solution

Therefore, use tangible objects as input and output devices.

## Implementation 

All objects of the real world can be input and output devices. They can be equipped with sensors or cameras to capture their orientation and appearance. The orientation of tangible objects, such as cards, paper sheets, cubes or even furniture, can be interpreted as input. Likewise, tangible objects can be output devices, showing different images, numbers, or colors. They can make different noises, move to different positions, or display images. Digital images can be projected to physical objects. The content of physical objects can be scanned and interpreted as input parameters.

## Consequences

 - (+) Tangible objects offer more natural interaction. They have a higher affordance and invite for action. They offer other ways of combinations than digital objects do. Software tools only allow the types of manipulation provided by the tool developers. Real objects offer options and limitations of the real world.
 - (-) Physical objects are more expensive, require storage space and only a limited number of objects is available. Working with the objects can be messy, which is great in a design process, but requires clean up and setup time.
