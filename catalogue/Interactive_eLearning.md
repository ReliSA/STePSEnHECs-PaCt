## Context

You are teaching an online class and are looking for additional resources and support.

## Problem

Creating a full course online for your students is time consuming and requires reviews and testing to be completed. When teaching standard classes like Calculus you should not need to create this material from scratch, but you may still want to add your own materials to elaborate or stretch the standards contents.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, evaluate the use of interactive learning systems that fit your classes and allow you to add contents as needed or desired. There are several tools on the market, for instance ZyBooks for STEM classes or Codio for Computer Science. These tools offer webnative contents where interactive activities and labs are integrated into the contents. Some tools are costly but have reasonable pricing for the students. If possible, you can get you college to support the purchase, or maybe the college already is using this type of tooling for other classes.
