## Synopsis

Have large scale interactive walls in your classroom or seminar room.

## Context

Learning groups need a shared space for presenting and discussing results. Simple projectors have only limited space and the presentation is quite static because objects cannot be manipulated directly.

## Problem

Static illustrations cannot fully account for the dynamics of the real world. When you explore a problem space, new insights and comments from peers will change your conceptual views. If the effort to change your conceptual representation is high, it is very likely to ignore important changes.

## Forces

 - Students need to be “on the same page”.
 - It is important for successful collaboration that objects can be changed and manipulated.
 - Everyone in the group should directly see what is changed on the shared pace.
 - Changing objects (resizing, repositioning) should be seamless. Transferring the user input should be easy, without hand-over of input devices such as mice or tablets.
 
## Solution

Therefore, provide opportunities to interact with the walls in the physical space to manipulate the digital space.

## Implementation 

Connect several interactive displays, whiteboards or projectors to one large interactive wall. Enable direct manipulation with fingers and pens. Ensure that multiple users can edit the content at the same time.

## Consequences

 - (+) A lot of content can be shown and manipulated. True collaboration on a large shared space becomes easier.
 - (-) Interactive walls are often misunderstood as teacher-devices. But they are group devices and everyone should be encouraged to use them. Large interactive walls take a lot of space while they are not always in use.
