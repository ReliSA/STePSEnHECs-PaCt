# Learning alcove

## Context

Campus life consists of a colorful hustle and bustle in which private and study-oriented situations merge into one another. Students need to switch between multiple forms of learning: self-organized or guided, individual or collaborative, in small or large groups, formal or informal. Transitions between these activities, social forms and media use should be seamless, especially when it comes to varying levels of privacy. In courses, certain activities demand secluded learning spaces, providing groups with temporary high privacy without complete isolation from the overall learning community. They should still feel as part of a bigger learning community and be perceived as active members of the group to remain available for dynamic interactions, while having a sense of great protection which enables undisturbed communication, advancing the groups work and development of results.

## Problem

Highly private spaces are usually self-contained, separate rooms, that often hinder smooth transitions and spontaneous shifts between activities, groups, and contexts. The desire for high privacy within the group alongside a simultaneous openness to the campus community therefore appears contradictory.

## Forces

 - **Social learning:** Students learn from each other in the group. Peripherally seeing what others do and joining a learning group offers many learning moments. For this, students need an environment in which they can form ad hoc learning groups that are both closed and open to other members.
 - **Informal character:** Even in formal settings, informal environments promote a more open and informal exchange and communication between all university members on an equal footing.
 - **Limited number of project rooms:** Due to the limited space available, there are often only a few freely accessible project rooms. In addition, these often have to be booked and are then often already occupied for short-term use. Booking in advance also prevents the spontaneous formation of learning or working groups.
 - **Zoning:** There are often areas on campus that are noisy and lively, such as the canteen or cafeteria, and quiet areas that allow for undisturbed work. However, there is also a need for areas that are suitable for group work and flexible usage scenarios. Clearly recognizable zones should be set up for each of these activities, which also offer transition areas for changing activities.
 - **Nesting:** On the one hand, students need privacy when studying alone and within a study group and like to use protected retreats for this. On the other hand, they also want to be part of a larger learning community and engage in a low-threshold exchange with other students and lecturers.

## Solution

Learning alcoves are openly accessible areas where you can sit comfortably, undisturbed and protected from noise, while at the same time being part of a larger, busier space. They can be integrated into various open areas, e.g. libraries, the canteen, learning arenas, foyers or passageways. They offer seating for 2-6 people, a work table with good lighting and are soundproofed, e.g. by felt walls.

## Implementation 

### Details

Learning alcoves are surrounded by wall elements and are often also separated from the top by a ceiling. Upholstered elements in particular create a noise-protected space that is nevertheless open to the surroundings on at least one side.

In order to support hybrid formats for individual and group work, Learning alcoves should offer an easily accessible [Nearby power supply](Nearby_power_supply.md) for laptops and smartphones - for example, through sockets embedded in wall elements or in the table top. A larger display can also be integrated into it - a Learning alcove with several seats in particular can thus become a soundproofed Workstation with (interactive) displays. Students can use their mobile devices for collaboration and also have a quiet environment to take part in video conferences with headsets, for example, without disturbing other people in the room with their own speeches.

### Obstacles

Particularly at peak times, available Learning alcoves can quickly become full. However, a booking or reservation system would contradict the open, informal nature of these workstations. A sufficient number of Learning alcoves should therefore be available across the campus. (Digital) Campus maps, which clearly display workstations for different usage scenarios and make it easier for students to find suitable learning spaces, can also provide support.

Learning alcoves can also be integrated into outdoor areas of the campus. (Planted) Stone and earth walls, hedges or trees as well as awnings can be used as partitions and noise protection. However, providing a good Wi-Fi connection and [Nearby power supply](Nearby_power_supply.md) can be a challenge in outdoor areas. These requirements should be included in the planning, at least when redesigning outdoor areas. However, it is also possible to upgrade existing seating areas, for example with photovoltaic systems.

Lastly, while soundproofing elements often shield the people inside the Learning alcove well from outside noise, their conversations in the surrounding room can still be clearly audible. This can be counteracted with the targeted placement of acoustic or soundproofing elements in the Learning alcove.

## Consequences

 - (+) Learning alcoves can be used in a variety of ways. They offer groups in particular, but also individuals, an open yet protected space for various forms of teaching and learning.
 - (+) They support informal learning and strengthen the campus as a place of encounter and social exchange.
 - (+) The quality of time spent on campus is increased, as students have a place that enables quiet (learning) activities as well as discussions and social interaction, especially for longer breaks between courses.
 - (+) Learning alcoves offer privacy and are also less isolated than [Learning boxes](Learning_box.md) or separate project rooms.
 - (+) Switching between different learning activities is encouraged. Students can move to the Learning alcoves if they need more privacy and want to talk without being disturbed. The noise-absorbing walls of the Learning alcove make working particularly pleasant.
 - (+) Learning alcoves create a pleasant, modern working atmosphere and are particularly popular in co-working spaces. Transferred to shared learning areas ("learning commons"), they are an important building block for co-learning scenarios.
 - (-) Learning alcoves do not offer a completely undisturbed environment, for example for confidential discussions. Interruptions by people passing by are possible at any time.
 - (-) As stated before, the work areas cannot be reserved. Even with a high number of them on campus and appropriate (digital) campus maps, they are not reliably available as a learning space at fixed times, for example for tutorials in small groups or as part of larger courses.
 - (-) Maintenance, cleaning and care of Learning alcoves are more time-consuming than in large rooms. Students must show a high degree of personal responsibility to ensure that these areas do not fall into disrepair.
 - (-) Learning alcoves are a relatively expensive way of creating space for self-organized learning. Not too many alcoves should be set up at once.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - Figure 1 shows Learning alcove in the "Lernarena" at the Cologne UAS.
 - Learning alcoves can be designed in the form of a house with a roof and an open side wall. In this form, they can be placed either free-standing in the room or against a wall. Figures 2 and 3 (left) shows an example of such a Learning alcove at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences with two benches facing each other and a work table. The ceiling, side walls and seats are padded for sound insulation. Lighting elements are embedded in the ceiling and there are [Nearby power supply](Nearby_power_supply.md) connections next to the table.
 - The example in Figure 3 (right) shows a Learning alcove at Utrecht University. It is made of wood, with two height-adjusted benches on opposite sides.
 - However, Learning alcoves can also be integrated directly into a room and delimited by the room’s side walls. Figure 3 illustrates different solutions for this. The example on the left shows a Learning alcove at Utrecht University: the Learning alcove was installed in a row with other uniform Learning alcoves along a corridor and provides open access to the corridor.
 - The example on the right (Figure 4) shows the integration of a Learning alcove into an existing alcove in a room on the campus of Leipzig University.
