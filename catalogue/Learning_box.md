# Learning box

## [Category](categories/categories.md)

## Context

Teaching at universities is increasingly project-oriented, offering various approaches to project execution. While some projects require workshops, others can be self-organized and completed at home. Many projects involve small teams of 2-4 or 4-8 individuals collaborating on tasks. Despite the rise of online collaboration, meeting in person fosters more intensive teamwork. Working on campus allows students attending courses to gather for group and project work, creating a conducive environment for undisturbed, private collaboration, where students can make the space their own, fostering a sense of privacy and ownership that enhances focused collaboration. The privacy and lack of distraction can be crucial for deep focus, creativity, and effective problem-solving during project work.

## Problem

There is a shortage of closed working areas on campus, leading to disruptions for teams using traditional study rooms, which are often interrupted by scheduled courses. Openly accessible learning areas, such as those in the canteen, are popular but are typically noisy and prone to disruptions from others. Therefore, dedicated and separated spaces are essential for effective group work. However, despite the necessity of such isolated environments, it’s important to maintain visibility of students’ activities, fostering curiosity and enabling lecturers to identify active teams or provide support as needed.

## Forces

 - **Room size:** The classrooms on campus are often designed for large groups: Lecture halls, seminar rooms and laboratories. These are integrated into the timetable and are frequently occupied. The use of large rooms for small groups is wasteful. In addition, the large rooms are uncomfortable for smaller groups, so rooms should be adapted to different group sizes.
 - **Learning limits:** If there is no space on campus for collaboration in small groups, project-oriented formats are only possible to a limited extent. This applies both to self organized learning and students’ own projects as well as to break-out sessions as part of courses.
 - **Supervision:** If students are working on a project on campus, they can get help from academic staff or lecturers more quickly. Lecturers also want to visit the project groups when they are working in break-out sessions.
 - **Transparency:** The use or occupancy of study rooms by project groups should be transparent for everyone. If there are few workspaces, then these should not simply be used as recreation rooms, but for study purposes. It should therefore be visible which activities are currently taking place in the room.
 - **Prepared for digital learning:** Project teams also use digital media in their collaboration. This applies to research as well as to the analysis, reflection and production of results. Digital tools such as online whiteboards, presentation software or collaborative writing tools are used. Students access their own digital learning environment and work with their preferred tools. At the same time, they want to present results to each other or work together in the same digital document.

## Solution

Learning boxes are small workspaces for groups of 2-8 people. Learning boxes can be integrated into existing rooms as a roomin-room concept using fixed partition walls. Glass walls or glass doors allow students to see whether the room is free and what is happening in it. Lecturers can see the activity of the students and watch out for signals as to whether help is needed. Students can see when others are approaching the room and can prepare themselves.

The boxes should be equipped with a [Nearby power supply](Nearby_power_supply.md) for laptops and smartphones. You can also provide working tools such as whiteboards, notepads or method posters. The room should contain at least one monitor or large display to which the students’ laptops can be connected.

## Implementation 

### Details

The Learning boxes should be well soundproofed. Doors clearly separate the boxes from the outside room, allowing undisturbed working. In all-round glazed Learning boxes, curtains fitted on the inside can provide flexible privacy protection as required. 

Lockable doors make it possible for a group to leave their belongings and materials locked in there, even when they go on break. Room bookings can also be used to control when a group is granted access. Room bookability is also an option for unlockable rooms. Depending on the space available, there can be a mixture of bookable and spontaneously usable, lockable and freely accessible boxes.By installing large displays, such a project room can also become a learning cinema if learning videos are offered for a module. Students can then watch and discuss the learning videos together as a group instead of consuming them alone at home. If there are many Learning boxes, lecturers can produce films that are geared precisely to this scenario and contain exercises for groups.

The Learning boxes can be implemented using exhibition systems, room systems or customized solutions from local joineries. Among other things, it is important that the Learning boxes have good, possibly automatic lighting and ventilation. Overall, as many Learning boxes as possible should be created so that use is not exclusive to just a few students.

### Obstacles

If Learning boxes are to be used as break-out rooms for a specific course, it must also be possible for lecturers to reserve them. This can block many rooms if necessary. This should be announced in good time and communicated transparently. Related to this, the utilization of the Learning boxes is difficult to plan. If students experience that Learning boxes are not reliably available on campus, acceptance and frequency of use may decrease. Therefore, an individual concept should be developed for which time units and how often rooms may be booked. Digital room booking systems can help with this.

## Consequences

 - (+) Learning boxes make the campus a more attractive place to spend time. The time between courses can be used more productively. It is now interesting for students to come to campus, even if they only have one formal course in a day, as they can continue working with other students afterwards.
 - (+) Learning boxes make many innovative teaching formats possible in the first place. These include a wide variety of project work forms as well as other timing and interlinking of instructional and self-organized learning phases. The change between formal and informal, between individual and social learning in small and large groups is more fluid.
 - (+) Learning boxes make an important contribution to making teaching more flexible, as they can be used in a variety of ways. They intensify social exchange on site, as they are inviting for project teams and learning groups.
 - (-) More space is needed for group work than in frontal settings, such as a lecture or seminar. As a rule, areas therefore have to be rededicated to use them as Learning boxes.
 - (-) Maintenance, cleaning and care of Learning boxes are more complex than for large rooms. Students must show a high degree of personal responsibility to ensure that the boxes do not fall into disrepair. Ideally, the boxes should be located in areas that are supervised, e.g. as part of a library or in the foyer of a university.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - As part of a comprehensive renovation of the university library, Kiel University (Christian-Albrechts-Universität - CAU) has integrated a whole series of Learning boxes (Figure 1) as room-in-room solutions for hybrid teaching and learning into the learning and working areas of the central library. The transparently designed Learning boxes include group workstations with presentation facilities and work booths for hybrid work or video production. They frequently incorporate curtains, enabling the creation of a more private learning or working environment as needed.
 - Various Learning boxes are also available in the University Library at the University of Basel. The University and Cantonal Library sees itself as a central learning and meeting place and offers, among other things, several separate booths as a room in-room solution that have been designed for different usage scenarios: as meeting boxes, as larger group boxes with wall displays or as Learning boxes with individual workstations. The richly illustrated open access publication "Laboratorium Lernräume - Neue Lernräume an der Universität Basel" [[SCH'23]](../References.md), published in 2023, provides a good insight into the [Learning landscape](Learning_landscape.md) of the University Library and the development of learning spaces at the University of Basel as a whole.
 - The University of Wuppertal also provides Learning boxes of varying sizes and shapes. Besides the medium sized rectangular one presented in Figure 2, which offers space for a maximum of four people, they also provide bigger circular Learning boxes (Figure 3) for meetings and project work with up to eight participants.
 - Lastly, the Ruhr West UAS in Mühlheim created a small Learning box (Figure 4) for two to four people by building a transparent yet soundproof outer framework around a [Learning alcove](Learning_alcove.md), making the workspace a bit more privat and autonomous.
