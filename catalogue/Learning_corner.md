# Learning corner

## [Category](categories/categories.md)

[Environment and Infrastructure](categories/Environment_and_Infrastructure.md)

## Context

Students need group workspaces for flexible group sizes, fluid levels of visibility and varying privacy within their learning environment. In a lot of situations, they want to be seen, provide insights into their own learning activities and be part of a larger learning community, without having to completely disclose their documents or media and thereby fully compromising their privacy. Corners resolve this conflict as they have both closed and open sides. They make it possible to view the room from a protected position, creating a pleasant, trusting, enclosed space and an open, safe atmosphere at the same time.

## Problem

As corners are ideal and comfortable places to learn, they have a strong attraction in all rooms. However, most rooms only have four corners and these are usually already used for other purposes or are already taken by other students, so that the demand cannot be met.

## Forces

 - **Open and protected:** Learners want to be simultaneously in a protected area with privacy and part of a larger learning community with an open working atmosphere. Behind closed doors, you can’t interact with others. But in completely open areas, it is noisy and students cannot work undisturbed and with a high level of concentration.
 - **Noise reduction:** Students do not want to be disturbed by ambient noise. At the same time, they want to be able to communicate at a normal volume without disturbing others. To achieve this, there must be opportunities in the room to use noise-absorbing elements such as pictures, acoustic elements or shelving.
 - **Temporary exclusivity of use:** Students need areas that they can declare as their workspace for certain periods of time and that should not simply be shared by others.
 - **Visibility:** Spreading out work materials, looking at the screen or actively discussing signals that active learning is taking place here. Others should be able to see that this is happening.
 - **Inspiration:** Students can inspire others through their learning activities and be inspired by others themselves. To do this, students must be able to look over each other’s shoulders, but each learning group should be able to decide for itself how much insight it wants to provide.

## Solution

In rooms that are designed for several learning groups (e.g. a learning center or a learning arena), Learning corners should be created that are designed for different group sizes. A Learning corner consists of at least one desk and several chairs or a bench in the corner. The seat backs are aligned with the two rear walls of the corner so that the seats face into the room. Additional corners can be created within a room by installing partitions or additional angles.

## Implementation 

### Details

2-3 seats should be created along each of the back walls. Each seat should have its own power connection. There are often power sockets in the corners of a room. In addition to the seating and the work table, there can be additional storage space, e.g. to set aside learning materials or a rucksack.

By aligning the line of sight into the room, students can look at their screen without others in the room being able to see it. At the same time, students can be seen by others and they can also see other students or learning groups. There can also be content that does not fall within the private working area of individual students and that can be displayed openly without restrictions. For this purpose, the walls in the corner can optionally be equipped with media, e.g. a display or whiteboard, with which the group can work together. This creates a smooth transition, controlled by the learning group, between private content shared within the group and publicly visible content. 

Movable partitions can also be used to turn [Learning isles](Learning_isle.md) distributed around the room into a Learning corner. When setting up [Learning boxes](Learning_box.md), gaps can also be deliberately left to create new corners in the room.

In contrast to [Learning alcoves](Learning_alcove.md) or a [Learning box](Learning_box.md), no structural measures are required if existing room corners are used. A Learning corner is also characterized by flexible group sizes: Additional chairs can be placed opposite the corner if the learning group becomes larger. As a rule, however, everyone in a small learning group should have a corner seat so that they can look into the open space instead of staring at the wall.

### Obstacles

Additional walls or structural inserts can create further corners in the room. However, the room should not become too restless or too dark. A pleasant atmosphere can be created by good, sometimes indirect lighting and, for example, potted plants that frame additional wall projections or partitions. 

Permanently installed benches can also have negative effects, as the often reduce accessibility. Care should be taken here to ensure that, for example, learners in wheelchairs can also sit comfortably in a corner and are not only given the unattractive outdoor seating.

It should also be kept in mind, that the Learning corners design defines if it can be used more for formal settings (e.g. working on a task) or informal settings (e.g. exchanging ideas). The seat height and table height give the Learning corner an individual character. A low table increases the informal character, but is rather unsuitable for working with a laptop. If possible, the desk can be supplemented with a small side table.

Lastly, in order for students to use the Learning corners productively, the work surface must be large enough. As seating should be arranged primarily on the closed sides and not on the open sides, it is important to ensure that the distance between the individual seats is not too large. Otherwise, participants will no longer be able to talk at a comfortable volume.

## Consequences

 - (+) Learning corners ensure a lively campus. Students are part of the action and can observe what is happening, see and be seen like in a café and still work in peace.
 - (+) Learning corners offer storage space and room to spread out your own study materials. Backpacks or jackets can be easily stored in a corner without becoming a tripping hazard for others.
 - (+) Corners give students a feeling of security and privacy.
 - (+) Additional learning media can be integrated into the Learning corners, e.g. displays or whiteboards.
 - (+) Learning corners are very suitable for collaborative writing: students sit next to each other at their own laptop and work on a document at the same time.
 - (-) Lecturers or other learners cannot sit down as easily in Learning corners as they can at free-standing tables or learning islands.
 - (-) The number of corners in a room is limited; additional corners may have to be created artificially.
 - (-) The layout of the room is not very flexible, the type of use of the corners is fixed.
 - (-) Due to the limited number of corners in a room, their use will always be exclusive and may disadvantage other groups sitting at less attractive group workstations.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - Figure 1 shows Learning corner at the "Lernarena".
 - The example shown in Figure 2 from HAW Hamburg demonstrates how Learning corners can also be created in the middle of a larger room area using cleverly placed dividing elements. High, mobile partition walls and planted room dividers create a protected "corner". If required, a large rollable screen can be pushed up to the Learning corner.
 - Figure 3 also shows an artificial Learning corner in a passageway on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with the raised backrests of the seating furniture forming a corner.
