## Synopsis

A Learning isle is a freely accessible table with several workstations for groups or individuals that is located in a larger room or area, e.g. within the library, a foyer or a Learning landscape. Students can sit down to study there without a reservation and are easy to find and visible to other students or lecturers.

## Context

In today’s university environment, students constantly juggle shortterm assignments and spontaneous meetings during and between classes. The focus on project-oriented teaching encourages both individual tasks and impromptu collaborations, for which students need openly accessible workspaces on campus. These spaces should facilitate quick meetings for group projects and provide an environment conducive to individual research. While privacy in these open workspaces can be beneficial for certain tasks, it is not essential for every academic activity and may even hinder student productivity and development in some cases. Ensuring sufficient availability of these spaces on campus is critical to accommodate all students and promote a productive and inclusive academic environment.

## Problem

Closed work areas make it possible to work in groups, but they often increase the amount of space required, as each room - both structural rooms and room-in-room systems - requires space for free movement in addition to the furniture. Thus, they often cannot meet the volume of demand. Moreover, it is often not possible to provide additional rooms for group work because no new building space is available and existing rooms are already used. Lastly, many rooms have unused, open areas or equipment that is no longer in use and could be better used for active learning.

## Forces

 - **Looking over the shoulder:** Students learn by looking over each other’s shoulders. This applies to both informal and formal educational settings. Particularly in the context of formal events, e.g. workshops or practical exercises, lecturers want to provide feedback and support by supervising learning activities. To do this, they should have as many learning groups as possible in view.
 - **Space and learning requirements:** Rooms on campus are often planned for specific purposes. In addition to the primary functions of a room (e.g. media provision, reception area, laboratory equipment), students must have the opportunity to study alone or in groups with their materials and to work on results. If group study rooms are separated from subject-related or social activities, breaks occur between learning activities so that the individual phases of learning are not optimally connected.
 - **Spontaneity:** Students would like to spontaneously form study groups or exchange ideas informally with other campus members. It must be clear to students where they can form ad hoc groups without prior planning or room bookings and where they can exchange ideas.
 - **Dwell time:** Students need intermediate spaces where they can linger for short or longer periods of time to study, discuss, snack or relax. They should not occupy rooms exclusively, but should be part of the learning community in the middle of campus life.

## Solution

A Learning isle is a work table for 4-8 people that is accessible from all sides. A power socket should be provided for each seat either underneath the table or in the middle of the table so that people can work with their own mobile devices. As it is open on all sides, additional learning media, e.g. mobile interactive displays, flipcharts or trolleys with digital equipment (e.g. maker blocks, creativity materials) can be pushed up to the table

## Implementation 

### Details

Learning isles are well suited for self-organized learning. This is particularly true within learning centers, learning arenas, foyers or learning areas in libraries. A variant of the Learning isle that can promote hybrid working in particular is the installation of a display on one side of the table. On the one hand, this takes away the complete openness, but on the other hand, learners can quickly view, discuss and further develop their digital materials together in a group.

Learning isles are particularly useful if they are combined with Flexible Furniture [[KOH'23]](../References.md) or learning objects from the environment. If Learning isles are integrated into a library, a laboratory or a makerspace, learning materials from the environment (e.g. books in the library, tools and building blocks in a creative environment) can be quickly brought to the table.

Learning isles invite you to linger for a short to medium term. Just like in a street café, it’s all about seeing and being seen. Monotonous corridors can be enriched by Learning isles by making them available for suitable learning activities.

Learning isles are an easy measure to implement as no structural measures are required. Simple tables and chairs already fulfill the function. However, as Learning isles are clearly visible to students, it is better to invest in high-quality tables and chairs if the budget is available in order to express appreciation for the students. Natural materials can also be used to create a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere conducive to learning, e.g. similar to cafés.

When setting up Learning isles, care must be taken to ensure that no escape routes are blocked and that students can still move between the Learning isles without feeling cramped.

### Obstacles

Without a power connection, use in hybrid scenarios is hardly possible. However, cabling can be a major challenge, especially when redesigning existing rooms. Building management should be involved in the planning at an early stage.

Furthermore, when setting up Learning isles, particular attention must be paid to the acoustics of the room, as unlike [Learning alcoves](Learning_alcove.md) or [Learning corners](Learning_corner.md), there are no protective walls to absorb sound. Conversations at the Learning isles must not increase the noise level in the room too much, while at the same time the group must be able to learn in peace. This can be remedied by mobile sound walls that can be added as required. Flexible curtain systems [[KOH'23]](../References.md) can be used to temporarily turn Learning isles into protected work areas.

## Consequences

 - (+) Learning isles allow for flexible group sizes, as chairs can be added on an ad hoc basis.
 - (+) Learners have enough space at a Learning isle for their own documents and enough space in the middle of the island to spread out shared documents or media.
 - (+) Learners can quickly sit down at a Learning isle. Unlike a [Learning corner](Learning_corner.md) or a [Learning alcove](Learning_alcove.md), they do not enter a "closed" group, as Learning isles generally have a more public character. A Learning isle can also accommodate individual students or two small groups.
 - (+) In a larger room with several Learning isles, groups can work in parallel. This has the advantage that lecturers have an overview of all groups and can react quickly to questions or problems when working on a task. The transition between plenary, group and individual work is seamless.
 - (+) Learning isles in highly frequented areas, e.g. in the entrance area, encourage chance encounters and informal exchanges.
 - (+) Learning materials and tools can be quickly retrieved and placed on or next to the Learning isle.
 - (+) If the Learning isles are not permanently installed but consist of Flexible Furniture [[KOH'23]](../References.md), small islands can become larger islands for more participants.
 - (+) Learning isles can be easily positioned almost anywhere in larger rooms and brought into line with structural requirements (escape routes, fire protection).
 - (+) Being able to "look over your shoulder" at Learning isles is both an advantage and a disadvantage. On the one hand, groups can react to each other, inspire each other and communicate with each other through informal, non-verbal signals. On the other hand, unlike [Learning alcoves](Learning_alcove.md), [Learning corners](Learning_corner.md) or [Learning boxes](Learning_box.md), Learning isles offer little privacy.
 - (-) Unlike a [Learning alcove](Learning_alcove.md), Learning isles offer little privacy. Students may feel observed and unprotected.
 - (-) Learning isles are less comfortable than other informal learning areas and may require more effort for additional acoustic protection.
 - (-) Learning isles are not suitable for very concentrated work, especially in passageways or very large areas, due to the restless environment.
 - (-) Supplying electricity can be difficult if there are no floor boxes.
 - (-) Learning isles tend to be classic learning spaces that sometimes have an overly school-like feel. Hybridity is often limited to using your own laptop. Mobile video conferencing systems tend not to be usable due to the openness within a room.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - Apart from the "Lernarena" (Figure 1), Learning isles can be seen at various locations of the Cologne UAS.
 - Examples for this include the location of the Code and Context study program in Cologne - Mühlheim (Figure 2)
 - and the Leverkusen campus (Figure 3). A notable aspect is that mobile tables are often used for such Learning isles. While these tables could be arranged and utilized in various other ways, these isles appear to provide the greatest benefit in most situations, particularly in academic programs that emphasize collaborative or group-based project work.
 - The University of Basel also presents different solutions for the design of Learning isles in the richly illustrated open access publication "Laboratorium Lernräume - Neue Lernräume an der Universität Basel" [SCH'23]. Learning isles have been integrated into specially designed learning areas as well as in transit areas.
 - Bielefeld UAS also offers Learning isles in various sizes, designs and seating options in different learning areas. As shown in the images (Figure 4), hallways and open intermediate spaces can be perfectly equipped with such Learning isles and made available for studying or group work.
