## Synopsis

A Learning landscape is a large, contiguous area that combines different room areas that merge into one another. The entire area is openly accessible and can be used flexibly. The Learning landscape offers zones for different noise levels, and the individual room areas also differ in terms of their furnishings and the space available for groups and forms of activity.

## Context

Everyday learning is diverse. Learning groups of different sizes - from individuals to small teams of 4-6 people to even larger groups - require differently designed areas. This applies to both self-organized learning and orchestrated courses in which students switch between different social forms (large groups, small working groups, individual work) and methods. Nowadays, media diversity is another decisive aspect, as different (digital) tools are needed for different tasks, e.g. interactive boards, simple whiteboards (which can be easily filmed or photographed) or small screens. In order to meet this wealth of requirements, learning institutions offer different learning and work spaces on campus, each for a certain form of learning.

## Problem

Didactic diversity requires a seamless change between methods, social forms, media and tools. This is often prevented because different rooms are not networked with each other and the respective working environment dictates how learning can take place within a narrow framework. Even though, the campus is supposed to enrich students learning experience, learners often have difficulty finding a suitable space. This is especially the case, when the forms of activity change several times - for example, between silent research, small group discussions and presentations in front of several people.

## Forces

 - **Switch between learning activities:** Different work surfaces and areas are ideal for different learning activities (receiving, reflecting, applying, exploring, designing, etc.). These should be seamlessly interlinked. This means that students do not have to move to other rooms or change the setup in the room in order to switch from one learning activity to the next. The more time-consuming it is to switch between learning activities, the less likely it is that spontaneous or planned switching between different activities will occur.
 - **Points of contact:** There should be points of contact between different working contexts and learning activities that enable a quick change, perhaps even invite it, but do not force it. Therefore, spaces must be created that offer a working area for open learning groups (e.g. at Learning isles), protected learning groups (e.g. at Learning boxes), a bit of both (e.g. at Learning corners and Learning alcoves) or even individual workspaces (e.g. at Video conference booths). It should be possible to switch smoothly between these work areas in order to do justice to the respective learning situation.
 - **Findability:** If students have to change rooms for different learning activities, they are spread out across the campus. This makes it difficult for both other students and lecturers to find a study group.
 - **Short distances:** Joining a learning group, as well as contact between students and lecturers, should be as low-threshold as possible. Lecturers should be able to join quickly to give feedback. And students can also give each other feedback more easily if they are learning in close proximity to each other.
 - **Everything in view:** When dividing a course into smaller groups, it is important that lecturers and students can look over each other’s shoulders. This is because groups learn from each other and lecturers want to see quickly where help is needed. However, people want to join a group slowly and not burst into a breakout session, as is the case with digital online tools.
 - **Presence:** In face-to-face courses, social groups are nested due to physical proximity. It would therefore be good if as many students as possible were together in one room while teams could still work undisturbed in a protected environment. On the one hand, you want to be able to see what is happening at the same time, but on the other hand you also want to be able to withdraw at any time.

## Solution

A Learning landscape is a large area for up to 100-200 people who can work on different tasks at the same time and learn in different group sizes and using different methods. The entire area is openly accessible and is divided into sub-areas that can be protected acoustically and from prying eyes as required, but are not partitioned off. Following this approach, a Learning landscape should make it easy to find free seats, switch between learning groups and activities, talk to each other, present your ideas and learn from each other.

## Implementation 

### Details

A Learning landscape comprises various group work areas, such as a [Learning alcove](Learning_alcove.md), a [Learning isle](Learning_isle.md), a [Learning corner](Learning_corner.md) or a [Learning box](Learning_box.md). By equipping it with Flexible furniture [[KOH'23]](../References.md), students can design their own ideal learning space, whereby the entire room should already allow flexible use of the space for different scenarios, e.g. self-organized learning, project work (such as design sprints or [[Hackathons]](Hackathon.md)), exhibitions or events.

The division of the Learning landscape into different areas can be done implicitly through furniture, equipment or color design. The different group work areas can be characterized by different furniture fabrics, table shapes or media, for example. An explicit division into different areas ("zoning") can be implemented using transparent glass walls, room dividers, counters or movable partitions or Flexible curtain systems [[KOH'23]](../References.md).

Various media should be available for presenting and developing content, e.g. fixed displays and whiteboards installed on walls, in [Learning alcoves](Learning_alcove.md), or [Learning boxes](Learning_box.md), or (interactive) displays and whiteboards on wheels. The respective areas should be equipped step by step so that the individual areas fit together. In addition, as many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the design and equipment in a participatory manner.

The learning environment is not a place of peace and quiet; discussions and laughter are explicitly allowed here. Nevertheless, the acoustic equipment should be such that project and working groups can learn undisturbed. The Learning landscape should radiate an active, positive and relaxed atmosphere. It should also be inclusive and safe. This also means that individual groups should not spread themselves too thin and become too loud. Social rules can be communicated with a wink through posters: both what is allowed and what is not. The personal responsibility of the students plays a major role in the success of this solution.

The Learning landscape is a shared space for students and lecturers. In principle, the Learning landscape is open for selforganized learning groups and informal encounters. However, it can also be used to form sub-groups within the framework of formal events, which then look for independent learning areas within the Learning landscape. In individual cases, the entire Learning landscape can also be used for a single course or a public event, e.g. to access different informal work areas as part of a formal event. However, this then reduces the reliable availability for selforganized learning. Whether the Learning landscape can be used for exclusive events at all should therefore be discussed with the various interest groups (students, lecturers, timetabling, campus management). If such use is planned, students should be informed transparently and reliably about availability.

The Learning landscape can support interdisciplinary learning activities in general and in this form be linked to a university library, for example. At larger universities, however, the design of a Learning landscape can also be geared towards the needs of a department: for example, makerspaces can be integrated for more technically oriented courses, while more humanities-oriented courses can create different discussion environments. Despite subject specialization, the Learning landscape should enable interdisciplinary collaboration with other departments or with partners from industry and NGOs, e.g. to promote service learning.

### Obstacles

The Learning landscape is generally open to students for selforganized learning and can also be part of a larger learning center, for example. If the Learning landscape is also used for courses and events organized by the university, this can lead to conflicts. For project-oriented events, for example, it can make sense to move a larger learning group from a lecture hall or seminar room to the Learning landscape. The subgroups then spread out into the individual areas of the Learning landscape. In this case, however, it must be ensured that there are no conflicts between the formally organized course and the informally organized learning groups. This can be achieved, for example, by announcing and reserving room areas in good time. A Learning landscape can also be blocked on certain days or at certain times for organized events. However, students must be able to rely on having access to free learning spaces for self organized learning activities, e.g. with guaranteed availability at certain times, days or weeks.

Furthermore, the Learning landscape is particularly attractive for use during breaks between courses or for longer learning and working phases if drinks and snacks are available nearby (e.g. from vending machines or in the form of a café). However, basic rules should be established as to whether and, if so, in which areas of the Learning landscape drinking and eating are permitted. Clearly visible waste garbage cans, for example at the exits, help to keep the area clean. Going further, cleaning and maintenance of the Learning landscape must be taken into account in the planning, as the rooms are used differently to traditional rooms.

In addition, electronic devices and cables must not become tripping hazards or dangers. Sockets should therefore be available in many places within the learning environment - for example at all seating areas and integrated into work tables. Cable ducts on walls and pillars, floor boxes or cables coming from the ceiling can supply the room’s media equipment with power.

Lastly, if the Learning landscape also contains Flexible Furniture [[KOH'23]](../References.md)., rules must be established to ensure that escape routes are not blocked and the various work areas are maintained. In addition, the furniture must be regularly tidied up and put back in order, otherwise the room will quickly look untidy.

## Consequences

 - (+) Self-organized learning and project-oriented event formats are encouraged by the Learning landscape on offer. There is plenty of learning space available for individual learning and group work.
 - (+) The campus becomes a place to learn and live. The Learning landscape on campus offers students with long commutes in particular opportunities to work on study topics outside of formal courses.
 - (+) Students also meet by chance and can easily find new study groups. The (informal) exchange between lecturers and students is easier if the Learning landscape contains seating areas that are also attractive for lecturers to linger in or for meetings.
 - (+) Innovative teaching formats such as [[Hackathons]](Hackathon.md)), design sprints, service learning or [[Flipped conferences]](Flipped_Conference.md)) are possible in these rooms.
 - (+) The attractive design of the Learning landscape makes it a center of attraction at public events and helps to open up the university for exchange with civil society and for cooperation with NGOs and industrial partners.
 - (-) The furnishings should be inviting and of a high quality, which results in high costs. This also applies to maintenance, as intensive and self-organized use means that tables or chairs may need to be replaced sooner.
 - (-) It is difficult to plan the utilization of the rooms. An empty Learning landscape is demotivating and makes the low level of activity in campus life visible. An overcrowded Learning landscape is frustrating, as it promises an offer for self organized learning, but does not reliably deliver on this.
 - (-) A large area is required for implementation. This may lead to resistance from individual institutions that would prefer a different use.
 - (-) If the learning environment is opened late in the evening, an additional security concept and staff support must be provided. A connection to the library, which often also has longer opening hours, can be a good approach.
