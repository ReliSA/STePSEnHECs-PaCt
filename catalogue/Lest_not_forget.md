## Context

During the project period you support the students to make the most out of their projects [[JAC'22]](../References.md). You act as a guide, more than as an assessor. While supporting, you observe the project team and its members. But there are many possible things to observe, and it is not possible to register all of them ’just in case’ you need them in the grading process. On the other hand, and this is more problematic, in a group process it is very well possible that you do not see what you should see to adequately assess differences in performance.

## Problem

How to collect your observations during the project, so that you have a good starting point for grading?

## Forces

 - **Good atmosphere in the project team.** If you do not sense any bad atmosphere (such as irritations or students not really taking part) during your visits to the team, there is a chance that individual differences will ’fall away’ into the bigger picture of the team. While guiding, you benefit from this: you speak to the team and the team picks up on the comments and the atmosphere remains good, but relevant individual differences do not always surface that way, and therefore do not make it to the individual grades.
 - **Producing good results for the customer.** All too often, we see happy clients with a working application, and failed team members because they did not meet all learning outcomes. One example is that the product owner can be perfectly happy with an application that is in fact made by only two of the four project team members. In this case probably two of them should fail. Another examples shows a team that appoints some team members to focus solely on development while others focus only on design. This might result in a good application as well, but in doing so they disable themselves to perform on both design and development learning outcomes. In this case all of them should fail. So, if you focus too much on the customer, you might oversee the differences within the team.
 - **Keeping your observations all for yourself.** While guiding your project team you act on lots of different situations. In many of these students will stand out in either a positive or a negative way. It is not always necessary or possible to share your thoughts with them immediately. Maybe you are in doubt if you saw it right. The force not to act upon it is tempting in the short term. But if you give early feedback, this might avoid later problems.
 - **Asking individuals about their contributions may feel awkward.** Some teachers feel it is awkward to get straight to the point and ask students about their contributions. They think they might get in trouble if the student contradicts of, worse, denies the statement. In their thoughts a simple question like: "I am worried about your contributions to the design, could you please explain them to me?" could be countered with "I think I did enough". Lack of experience in this kind of talks or distrusting your own observations might be a recipe for not bringing the subject on the table.
 - **Not knowing where the line between sufficient and insufficient will be.** Because the course of a project is unpredictable, it is difficult to know in advance whether a project team or an individual has made (in)sufficient contributions. So you take the safe side and do not share your thoughts with them. As a teacher, this can make you uncertain, especially if you are a newbie.

## Solution

The solution shows that producing excessive notes after your visits to the project team is not necessary at all to be certain of your observations. Remembering your observations is quite enough.
 - **Talk to your colleagues on a weekly basis.** Share your observations in the teacher team and estimate every individual student’s chances to pass the project. This talk can be done in person, but a call can serve perfectly well. Be careful to be too focused on only having your own opinions confirmed. End the discussion with a conclusion: is any action towards students needed, and who takes which action? This could be anything between looking in depth to some work of the specific student, or talking to them. Next week: report back to your colleagues and form a shared image again. Mind that however important and necessary it can be to talk about the progress of the assignment as a whole, this talk should be about individual students and their chances to pass the project.
 - **Ask the students to write minutes on your remarks during your visits to the project team.** Ask them to place these minutes in the tool stack, or any other place you both have access to. These minutes help the students not to forget what you think is important, and you could refer back to them during your next meetings with them. But most of all: you can get back to them while preparing your grades.
 - **Contact those students you still have doubts about towards the end of the project.** Sit down with them, tell them that you are in doubt and why, and invite them to tell their story. For example: "If no context is given I would think you did not yet contribute much to the documents, could you please give an explanation?" Most of the times they will be surprisingly honest. To prevent you from forgetting a worthwhile answer: ask them to mention it in their reports. Only if you are still in doubt after this talk, you will have to put an extra effort in their grading by assessing their own report on their work.

## Consequences

 - (+) Students know where they stand as you discuss your observations with them. This helps them to adjust in time, if they are heading for a pass at any moment in time. If if necessary they can divide the work accordingly/differently.
 - (-) To avoid administrating too much, he process is partly built on oral guidance. This might feel difficult to fall back on, when you are in doubt during grading.
 - (-) Taking compact and telling notes is difficult for many students. If they are sloppy, you will not be able to use them in your grading process.
 - (-) If you fail to build confidence during your visits to the team, a talk about the impression you get from the metrics might become complicated. Why would the students trust you now?
