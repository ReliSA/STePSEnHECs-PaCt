## Context

You are in the beginning of the project. You have been debriefed by the instructor and know what is expected from you. You received a deadline, resulting in a time-span in which you will have to complete the project.

## Problem

The project can not be finished successfully if you are running out of time.

## Forces

 - *Unaware of Workload.* The group does not have an estimation of the amount of work that has to be done. This could lead to the possibility that the time in which the amount of work that has to be done is more than the actual time-span left of the project.
 - *Unknown Project Status.* A group member is not sharing information — about her work progress, problems, decisions or the work she does — with the group. Resulting that the group is not aware of the current status of the assignment.
 - *Wrong Priorities.* A group member is working on a task which is of less importance at the current moment of the project.
 - *Task Dependencies.* A group member cannot finish her task, because she needs the result of another task.
 - *Decision Making.* A decision by itself is not good or bad but if only one group member makes all of the decisions alone or members decide for themselves, without sharing their thoughts or taking the whole group in consideration. This could lead to conflicting choices and could even result in the group having to redo the work completely.
 - *Unreported Problems.* Sometimes there is a drawback on a certain task. If this is not discussed, there is a possibility that the work will not be finished on time.

## Solution

Use project-management to control the variety of tasks and to improve the efficiency of the group.

## Implementation

In a project, different responsibilities are involved. These could be categorized and specified as a role. To those responsibilities tasks could be assigned. For instance, the role of team leader would hold the responsibility of planning, organizing, monitoring and motivating. His tasks would be to arrange meetings, keep track of progress among the group members, define tasks and work products and put them into a schedule. Or the role of a front-end developer would hold the responsibility of usability, design, development and documentation. His tasks would be to design and develop software interfaces and to write user documentation. Or maybe the group shares most of all the responsibilities. But it always starts with a pile of work that has to be done. Managing that pile of work and [SPREAD TASKS APPROPRIATELY](Spread_Tasks_Appropriately.md) could increase the efficiency of the group significantly. By [REGULARLY CHECK REQUIREMENTS FULFILLMENT](Regularly_Check_Requirements_Fulfillment.md) you could check if the current work done meets up the defined criteria.

You should make a decision about how you are going to manage the project. By choosing a project-management methodology, for instance PRINCE21, SCRUM2 or OpenUP3, it will give you an appropriate and structured approach on project management. Project-management methodologies like PRINCE2, SCRUM or OpenUP prescribe roles and their responsibilities, but also specify work products which you could use to support your team to achieve your project goals. It will also help the group to improve and manage their project as a team. Only if you are experienced with team managing or if your team has been working efficiently together, you could also use your own way of managing the project.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - A group of students got an assignment for 10 weeks. A project leader was assigned by the teachers, but he didn’t take his job seriously. After a week no one knew what the status was or what needed to be done. 2 people worked on the same part and one delivered nothing. In the third week there was a mid-term assessment. This resulted in a bad grade, because the products that were delivered didn’t meet with the requirements.
 - So the group decided to manage the project on their own in order to reach a better collaboration. Another project-leader was chosen and she worked out a schedule and arranged meetings on every Wednesday. They also used an online tool with an issue list, to report the problems they encountered. During the weekly meetings, work-parts and the issue-list were discussed. Upcoming tasks were divided and the schedule was adjusted if needed. In the end the use of this project-management contributed to a better final grade.
