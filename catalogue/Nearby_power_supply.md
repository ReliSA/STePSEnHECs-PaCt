# Nearby power supply

## Context

Mobile devices, such as laptops or smartphones, are important tools for studying. Students use them to access digital learning resources, create and save their own notes and work results or use digital collaboration and communication tools during courses and selfstudy. Studying on campus takes place in a hybrid learning space consisting of a physical and digital learning environment - both in courses and self-directed at individual workstations and group workstations such as [Learning isles](Learning_isle.md), [Learning boxes](Learning_box.md), [Learning alcoves](Learning_alcove.md), etc. The mobile devices you bring with you (bring your own device) are a constant companion in everyday study life and must be supplied with power or charged regularly.

## Problem

Many learning locations on campus are inadequately equipped with a power supply. Without a power supply, however, it is simply impossible to work continuously in hybrid teaching and learning settings.

## Forces

 - **Hybrid teaching and learning:** Hybrid scenarios are not limited to students connecting online on campus. Rather, it is about integrating digital media into face-to-face teaching and learning on campus. The German Council of Science and Humanities (2022) recommends that universities move towards a digital campus. However, this requires a comprehensive power supply for student devices.
 - **Fairness:** Newer mobile devices have long battery life so that a power socket is not always needed. However, this disadvantages students who use older devices and therefore need faster access to power outlets to charge their devices. Due to the mobile use of devices, the battery level is often already low, e.g. when studying on public transport on the way to university.
 - **Interruption of work:** Even newer devices run out of battery at some point. If this happens in the middle of project work and the device cannot be connected to the power supply, the joint work must be interrupted. Students who are on campus may also be excluded from online events because they cannot supply their device with power.
 - **Intensive use of rooms:** As rooms are a valuable resource, the aim is to achieve a high utilization of freely accessible learning rooms. However, this can only be achieved if students can use their own work equipment and, in particular, their own mobile devices for learning.
 - **Cable clutter:** As students have to supply their mobile devices with power somehow, they often become inventive and bridge the distance between the socket and laptop with hanging cables or long cable runs. These cables quickly become tripping hazards. The tangle of cables creates clutter on desks and seats, can disrupt concentration and distract from learning processes.

## Solution

Learning spaces must be equipped with sufficient sockets for all those present, which are easily accessible and expose as little cable run as possible. The Nearby power supply must be considered early on in the room planning process as it is a critical success factor. In addition to Nearby power supply connections in the wall, sockets can also be integrated into tables and other pieces of furniture to avoid long cable runs and clutter. Charging columns, floor boxes and distribution boxes suspended from the ceiling can increase accessibility to the Nearby power supply.

## Implementation 

### Details

The supply of electricity may be perceived as a truism or trivial solution. However, this solution component is actually a critical element in hybrid learning spaces. Without a Nearby power supply, there is no hybrid teaching. At the same time, a comprehensive supply of power sockets is a major challenge, as much lower requirements were planned for old buildings and rooms.

Electricians must be involved in the planning and implementation to ensure that there are no dangerous installations or overloads. Placing sockets directly at the learning locations is the ideal solution. Sockets are located directly at or under the workstation, e.g. embedded in the wall, in the table or in a bench. They can also be recessed or mounted as a distribution socket on (supporting) pillars, as well as simply be on the table through a distribution socket outlet.

The sockets should be easily accessible from all seats and take up as little work space as possible. The fewer sockets and cables there are on work tables, the more freely you can think, work and interact within a group. At the same time, sockets should be well protected from liquids, such as an overturned coffee cup. To this end, they can be positioned slightly higher, fitted with protective flaps or, for example, rotatably embedded in work tables so that they are protected when not in use and a smooth work surface is created.

Socket distributors suspended from the ceiling are a solution for supplying power to places far away from the wall in larger rooms. However, they also make a large amount of cable visible in the room. Depending on the room design, this can quickly become unsightly or even disruptive.

Floor boxes hide Nearby power supply connections when they are not needed. Ideally, floor boxes are not freely accessible, but are used to supply power to work tables and seating above them. This prevents flipped-up catches from becoming tripping hazards or cables protruding from the tanks in an untidy manner.

In addition to conventional sockets, USB charging stations can also be installed. They can also be located in lockers to charge end devices when not in use. Different options for Nearby power supplys can be seen in Figure 1.

In conclusion, the number of power adapters should also be considered. How many are sufficient, and when do they become excessive? Here you can follow a simple rule of thumb: Always ensure that there are enough power adapters to support half of the maximum potential users.

### Obstacles

The positioning of power sockets can restrict free room planning. Here, trade-offs need to be made between the optimal placement of furniture and the Nearby power supply. Ideally, cables are hidden under furniture and sockets are integrated into furniture. Fixed charging points and power columns in particular can conflict with room flexibility. When planning, it is therefore important to consider which furniture should be movable and which should be fixed.

It is also essential to consider the various categories of devices involved. Not only do students’ mobile devices need to be supplied with power, but larger, mobile displays also require an easily accessible Nearby power supply and possibly a mains connection in the room, depending on where they are used. Ideally, the most likely locations for mobile displays should therefore be identified and equipped with Nearby power supply connections as early as the room planning stage.

Conversely, room aesthetics should also be taken into account when installing sockets. After all, too many sockets and power cables are not only unsightly, but can also be a distraction or a tripping hazard. In case of doubt, however, safety should take precedence over aesthetics: If it is not possible to do without longer cables on the floor in individual places, their visibility can be significantly increased, for example, by using orange cable sheathing.

Accessibility and security aspects should also be taken into account for the Nearby power supply. Different types of power supplies pose different threats, of which many be eliminated through proactive planning. Floor boxes for instance offer a good way to conceal cables, but their handle and cover are often tripping hazards, which is why they should at least be secured with adhesive or covered with a mat. Ceiling power adapters can pose a risk of head injuries, so they should be placed directly above tables whenever possible, and not above seating areas or in hallways. In addition to avoiding these risks, accessibility for people in wheelchairs should also be taken into account if possible.

Occasionally, borrowing power banks is suggested as an alternative or supplementary solution if there is an insufficient Nearby power supply in the room. However, organizing the loan is timeconsuming. Untested devices also pose a high safety risk.


## Consequences

 - (+) Hybrid teaching scenarios are made possible by a comprehensive Nearby power supply on campus.
 - (+) Students can use their own devices and access their personal digital learning environment anywhere.
 - (+) A sufficient Nearby power supply enables students to work in a variety of ways at different locations on campus.
 - (+) Longer learning phases are possible, work phases are not interrupted due to a lack of battery power.
 - (+) Rooms are used more intensively, the campus becomes more attractive.
 - (+) Students reduce their electricity bills.
 - (-) The intensive use of digital devices and the charging of batteries also increases energy consumption, resulting in higher electricity costs for the university.
 - (-) There may also be a wasteful use of resources, as these are free for users.
 - (-) Poorly accessible or unprotected sockets can quickly pose a safety risk. Students also connect their untested devices to the university’s power grid. In the worst case scenario, devices are connected that are not approved for use (e.g. imported devices without a CE seal).
 - (-) Expensive conversion measures may be necessary to ensure a safe and comprehensive Nearby power supply in teaching and learning rooms on campus.
 - (-) Room flexibility decreases as furniture can no longer be moved freely if there are dependencies on Nearby power supply connections.
 - (-) Specialized furniture with integrated power sockets often incurs a high cost and also requires greater maintenance.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - Figure 2 shows Integrated Nearby power supply from the ceiling at the Cologne UAS.
 - Figure 3 shows examples of the integration of sockets in seating furniture. The sockets are recessed underneath the seat, the power cables are not visible from the outside and run inside the furniture.
 - A frequently encountered solution is Nearby power supply via sockets embedded in the table top (Figure 4). A built-in folding or rotating mechanism allows the sockets to be concealed in the table as required.
 - If, for structural reasons, the Nearby power supply is provided via the ceiling of the room, both a flexible solution with lowerable sockets suspended from the ceiling (Figures 1 and 2) and a solution with permanently installed pillars (Figure 5) can be selected.
