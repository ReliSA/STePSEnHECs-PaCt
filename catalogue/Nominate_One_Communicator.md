## Context

## Problem

Sometimes different groups have to communicate during a project or a group has to communicate with a teacher very often. If everybody communicates with everybody then there is a high chance of inefficient and vague communication, which hinders all groups in their work.

## Forces

## Solution

Determine fixed communication moments and give one group member the responsibility for communicating with the other teams or the teacher.
