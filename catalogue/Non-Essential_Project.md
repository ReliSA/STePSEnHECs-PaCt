# Non-Essential Project

## Also Known As

Not Business Critical, Customerâ€™s Side Project, Work on the Non-Business-Critical

## [Category](categories/categories.md)

[Team and Project Setup](categories/Team_and_Project_Setup.md)

## Synopsis (optional)

How not to risk relationship between teachers and customers inherent in students working on core business? Accept projects that are not on the customer’s critical path or essential for their operations.

## Context

We are running or planning to establish a (at least) semester-long university course on software engineering with collaborative student projects and including some aspects or the entire process of agile development. The goal being to provide learning by experience of agile principles and practices as well as general project management skills. No prior knowledge or experience of the students in these domains is assumed.

## Problem

How to minimize the risk of the course staff jeopardizing their working relationship with either internal (colleagues) or external (industry partners) customers inherent in students working on parts of their core problem domains?

## Forces

 - Students need a topic to work on, and industry-oriented ones have their unique interesting factors, such as opportunities to interact with external customers and the potential to use new or different technologies.
 - Companies and other organisations may be willing to collaborate with student projects seeking to start relationships that may lead to future hiring. However, this goal often takes second place when faced with the daily work and demands of the business, sometimes resulting in limited availability.
 - The student, as well as the course staff, cannot guarantee the extent and quality of the products the teams deliver as the product is at best a co-equal, often even secondary, goal next to practical education in processes and practices.

## Solution

**Accept projects that are not on the customerâ€™s critical path or essential for their operations.**

When outside organisations decide to assume the customer role, they are giving students the opportunity to get a taste of "the real world", with them being able to form connections with practitioners and learn more about how different organisations operate, all in addition to practising agile methods and learning through iterative delivery.

Giving customers an opening to propose project topics that fall outside of their main products and features can give them this opportunity to build bridges with the university and the people who will be entering the workforce in the future, while minimising the inherent risk that comes with student projects --- where the quality of the end result can vary to the point that there may not be much there at all.

## Consequences

 - (+) Non-Essential Projects enable students and educators to be connected to outside organisations, while reducing any risks that come from the variable quality of student projects. These opportunities can help kickstart the students' future careers, as they come into the workforce with connections and a world-view that is closer to the practitioners' reality.
 - (+) If customers' expectation is lowered and not critically dependent on the projects' results, the room for disappointment shirks, yet there is still space to be pleasantly surprised.
 - (-) Companies may not be interested in proposing topics that are not useful for them; as they would be taking on the role of a customer, the availability required of them to be in meetings and work with the students may not be worth it for them.

This results in mostly nice-to-have applications, extensions, integrations, etc. being proposed by the external customers and supporting software for research projects larger in scope than individual thesis topics being submitted by internal customers.   
 - [Team Project](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/files/curricula/2025/syllabus/IE_sem5_MLE5012_en_dsuciu_2025_9414.pdf) - The project topics are often proposed by industry specialists but have limited significance and serve primarily for educational purposes.
