## Context

You want to engage students and create a class community from the start of the semester.

## Problem

The students are meeting online in the class but most likely they do not know each other. They will get a higher benefit from the class if they can interact with each other. They also need to interact with the educator and quickly build up a trust relationship.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, start the class with doing a personal introduction of the educator and of each student. For the educator you can be more detailed, by not only providing some background about yourself and a photo or video, but also your perspective on each topic, and information about your availability for one-to-one communication with students â€” via email, chat, office hours (face-to-face or virtual). For the students they should share some of their motivations for taking the class, their major, and something about their communication style, if they are in a different time zone than the college, and if possible, something funny or interesting. Peer learning and sense of community formed through discussions is very valuable so during the first week of the class you can have all students participate in an introductory discussion. Some students are shy and may not be comfortable with sharing so this should be held in a light tone and be reasonably flexible about the content and participation.

Figure 1: Personal Introductions

> "Well-thought-out introductions are the key to establishing a sense of presence in your online classroom. Doing that, it turns out, can lead to all kinds of benefits, like the amount of communication you have with your peers, your satisfaction with the course, and even how much you feel you are learning." - Linnea Sudduth, Colorado State University
