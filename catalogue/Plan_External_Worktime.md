## Context

## Problem

Some team members might have a job beside their study, and working on the group assignment and the job simultaneously is distracting. Such a group member is of less value for the whole group.

## Forces

## Solution

Plan breaks on a regular basis which offer the group member to focus on the job outside of the group assignment. During the rest of the time the group member can focus on the inside of the group assignment
