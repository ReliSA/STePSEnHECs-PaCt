## Synopsis (optional)

How to assemble teams quickly and minimize the initial social and inter-personal hurdles? Allow teams to self-assemble to create a sense of ownership and freedom of choice.

## Context

We are running or planning to establish a (at least) semester-long university course on software engineering with collaborative student projects and including some aspects or the entire process of agile development. The goal being to provide learning by experience of agile principles and practices as well as general project management skills. No prior knowledge or experience of the students in these domains is assumed.

New students enrol into our course. The semester has either just begun or is close to it. The actual work on the projects should start in the near future.

## Problem

How to assemble the teams from the individual students quickly and in a way that minimizes the initial social and inter-personal hurdles?

## Forces

 - Teams need to be formed relatively quickly for the work on the projects to start.
 - Being forced to cooperate with newly acquainted or unfitting team members (on personal or professional level) can lead to resentment, tension and frustration in the team.
 - Some, but not all, students formed interpersonal relationships in their previous studies or personal lives and have a pallet of (soft and hard) skills each that can be complementary or contrary to each other, none of which the course staff is necessarily aware of.
 - Trying to assemble the "perfect" teams puts a lot of pressure and effort on the course staff in the setup stage, especially if the number of students is high.
 - The teams need to meet certain general (e.g., \textsc{Team Size Limitation}) or course-specific criteria.
 - A completely hands-off approach to team formation can lead to breaking the aforementioned criteria, lead to delays or leave some students out in the cold.

## Solution

**Allow and encourage to form the teams on their own at the very beginning of the course or (if possible) even before.**

Make them aware of any criteria that need to be met and give them a near enough deadline to "register" their team composition and put a approval/vetting process in place to review the teams formed. After the deadline has passed, resolve any cases where full teams were not formed - such as incomplete teams or isolated students without a team - using accessible knowledge and your best judgment. 

## Consequences

 - (+) Teams form quicker when students leverage their interpersonal relationships and prior experience with each other, compared to if the staff needed to learn about them first.
 - (+) Due to the vetting process, any and all criteria for the teams are still met, or at the very least, their exceptions are monitored and regulated by the course staff.
 - (+) Joining a team voluntarily, as opposed to getting stuck in one by a decree from authority, is one less frustration students need to deal with with navigating the already tricky realm of team dynamics and collaboration.
 - (+) Self-assembled teams can feel higher measure of ownership and autonomy of their team and the project as a whole.
 - (+) The chance of a lone student without a team needing to work on a solo project is dramatically lowered.
 - (-) Some resentment can still arise in those teams forced to accept lone students, or those formed entirely from such individuals.
 - (-) Even voluntarily formed teams may face issues in team dynamics and cooperation, which still needs mediation and other actions from the course staff.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s) 

 - [Advanced Software Engineerng](https://portal.zcu.cz/portal/studium/prohlizeni.html?pc_pagenavigationalstate=AAAAAQAGNjY0ODM5EwEAAAABAAhzdGF0ZUtleQAAAAEAFC05MjIzMzcyMDM2ODU0NzY3NTM1AAAAAA**#prohlizeniSearchResult) - Students are told to form the teams of the expected size on their own at the very beginning of the term and given at most two weeks to do so. As part of their registration they also assign the team lead (or at least a contact person), express their preferences for project topics (see [Team's Choice](Teams_Choice.md)) and provide their team profile in regards experience with different technologies. The course staff vet the team registrations and make any changes as necessary. Any students unassigned to any team by the deadline (if any) are either assigned to as existing team or grouped together to new teams. Either is done based on the target team size, technical experience compatibility, preferred topics and other criteria.
 - [Team Software Project](https://portal.zcu.cz/portal/studium/prohlizeni.html?pc_pagenavigationalstate=AAAAAQAGNjY0ODM5EwEAAAABAAhzdGF0ZUtleQAAAAEAFC05MjIzMzcyMDM2ODU0NzY3NTMzAAAAAA**#prohlizeniSearchResult) - The process is broadly similar to the one used in ASWI. Only it starts several months before the term starts and it is supported by a custom web application for team registrations and searching for teammates. If the team is at least partially enrolled in both courses, TSP version is followed.
 - [Software Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=541882), [Large Scale Software Development](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=518806) -- Students in the same lab class self-assemble in teams depending on the team size defined by the teachers during the first lab class. When teams deviate from the expected size (either when a team has too many students or there are students without a team), the teacher intervenes and facilitates team assembly with the students.
 - [Team Project](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/files/curricula/2025/syllabus/IE_sem5_MLE5012_en_dsuciu_2025_9414.pdf) - Project teams used to be formed randomly or based on various other criteria, but participants' motivation was negatively affected. Now, they use self-assembling teams following exactly this pattern.
 - [Software Construction](https://www.fhnw.ch/plattformen/swc/) - Uses an online sign-up sheet for students to form teams.
 - System Engineering course[^1] - Students are free to form the teams on their own.
