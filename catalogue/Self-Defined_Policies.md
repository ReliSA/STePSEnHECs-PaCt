## Context

## Problem

Rigid detailed policies on everything (code, notations, roles, tools, planning strategies, etc.) imposed on the teams are more easily dismissible, foster resentment and block learning through experimentation.

## Forces

## Solution

**Define just as much of the process as necessary (for comparisons and manageability on the course level) and give students free reign over the rest. Also, be prepared to bend or change even the process structure you do have if they come with a justified case for it and explicitly encourage such ideas.**
