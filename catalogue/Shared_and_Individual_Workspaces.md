## Synopsis

If students are using their own personal tools for documenting their work, a course aggregator can gather students’ work and present it in one place.

## Context

Students work on solutions and contributions individually or in small groups. At the end of such a work phase, the results need to be shared or presented to the whole group.

## Problem

Individual and shared workspace are not the same. Students need a way to make their selected results available to others without effort. Their individual work should be protected, that is nobody should sneak into their works-in-progress or private notes.

## Forces

 - Students could share and present results on a large screen, see [CONNECTED INTERACTIVE WALLS](Large_Interactive_Walls.md), but connecting individual devices to a projector or display takes time, and one can only see the results of one student or group.
 - Students could also use screen sharing among their devices, but then only results of one contributor are shown.
 - Projection of individual devices to a large screen and screen sharing allow presentation in a sequence.
 - But all individual contributions should be connected, and sharing of information should take place at any time, whenever students feel comfortable.
 - Thus, one can compare or aggregate results. The shared results should be accessible to others seamlessly.
 
## Solution

Therefore, have one shared workspace, and many individual workspaces. Students can post results, ideas or inputs from their individual workspace to the shared workspace whenever they want.

## Implementation 

The shared workspace can be on an interactive whiteboard, a web based virtual whiteboard, or an additional document to aggregate content. It could be special a Wiki page or a Twitter wall. It can be [LARGE INTERACTIVE WALLS](Large_Interactive_Walls.md).

The important detail of the solution is that students can work on their own. Whether it is a complex solution or just a contribution in a brainstorming – students need to enter content in an individual non-public interface first. Ideally this interface is adapted to the situation, e.g. instead of showing the shared workspace it offers an individual input field.

Connecting to the shared workspace should be made as easy as possible. This could be done with sessions codes or students need to login into a shared platform, such as a Wiki or Google Docs.

## Consequences

 - (+) Content and solutions are aggregated into one shared workspace. Solutions can be compared or categorized. A shared workspace enables collaboration and contributions are aggregated. Whatever is visible on the shared workspace can inspire other learners and groups.
 - (-) Organizing several workspaces means more effort. Teachers may not get access to individual workspaces to provide feedback. More contributions require more time to get all items organized within the shared workspace. Students may get confused or overwhelmed by large number of contributions.
