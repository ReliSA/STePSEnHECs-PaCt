# Start Immediately

## [Category](categories/categories.md)

## Context

A group assignment is given to a group of students, which includes deliverables that has to be finished on a prearranged date. You find yourself at the beginning of the project.

## Problem

The students are procrastinating to work on their project. No progress has been made and they are now afraid it would affect the quality of their project and possibly their grades.

## Forces

 - *Postponement.* The group members reschedule the appointments made to work on the assignment to a later date. Or they cancel the meetings or do not make the work on the time given for the assignment.
 - *Moving Force.* The students do not have any interest in the subject or they lack the motivation to start with the assignment. It can be also from an issue from a task that was assigned to them. The project is not started and the task at hand is not being performed.
 - *Unclear Instructions.* The students do not understand some -  or all - parts of the assignment. They do not know what to do.
 - *Conflicts.* The students do not want to work with each other, because a conflict occurred among the group members.

## Solution

Once an assignment starts, exchange personal information and discuss the possible working times. Set up a meeting schedule, make a planning and start working on the assignment as soon as possible.

## Implementation

The problem of this pattern is most common. An assignment is given to a group of students but they don’t start with it directly, resulting in a shorter period of time to complete the assignment and an increased working pressure because there is less time available. Also, if you start directly, you will still have all information clear in your head. If you start working on it at a much later point, you probably already forgot some of the required information.

Start by sharing your personal information and plan some meetings. Once this is done, the group should start working immediately on the tasks ahead. Starting immediately gives you the best benefit of the given time.

If some of the students do not understand some - or all - parts of the assignment, [CLEAR UP QUESTIONS](Clear_Up_Questions.md) immediately so every group member knows what they have to deliver. Otherwise, the work the students do could be wrong. This means more time will be spent on adjusting the work products when the mistake is found to meet up with the expectations.

Once every group member understands the assignment, start [SPREAD TASK APPROPRIATELY](Spread_Tasks_Appropriately.md) directly at the first meeting. Now, every one knows what he has to do.

Sometimes, the teachers make the groups, so the students can not choose who they will work with. It is possible a group contains students who have/had a conflict with each other. As soon as problems emerge, [RESOLVE CONFLICTS](Resolve_Conflicts.md) immediately to prevent the project from stagnation. It will also prevent that the rest of the group lose focus waiting for the problems to resolve.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - A group assignment divided over a period of six weeks was given to a group of students. They started to work on the assignment four weeks after assignation. Even during the remaining two weeks, minor progress was made. Most work was done during the last two days before the deadline. When the work products where rated, the products did not meet the defined requirements. This resulted in a low grade.

 - When asked about what the cause of this was, it seemed that the group was just postponing the assignment and were canceling appointments made. The reason was that instructions of the assignment where vague and they did not take any actions cause their motivation was too low.

 - The group was given a second chance, and this time, they started working on the assignment immediately. Any ambiguities regarding the assignment were solved directly by asking the teacher about it. This change of behavior gave the students a clear picture of the products that had to be delivered. During their first meeting they spread the tasks among the team members. Every team member now knew what he had to do.

 - With the correct tools applied and a better use of their time, the members of the team knew how to go further in the project and what they could achieve. Their motivation about the class increased with their recent success.
