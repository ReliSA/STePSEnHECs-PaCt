## Context

You are building up the contents on an online class.

## Problem

In an online teaching context, your students will interact with the teaching materials not only during the class but asynchronously with the lectures. This is creating new demands on the course materials that are now more prominent in the learning rather than supporting the interactive sessions.

## Forces

## Solution

The foundation of success is to have a very clear structure with informative headings to support the content overview and navigation. Students who chose to be less involved need to know what your fundamental contents are, but for the [Grown Up Student](Grown_Up_Student.md) there can be interesting additions to explore. You can incorporate alternative paths and parts to provide the students with interesting options and pull in from publicly available lectures and other resources to expand and support your core material. Videos, photos, and eBooks all help to improve the lessons. It helps tailor the education and make the classes more dynamic while also being cost effective.

> "Outlining your online course means dividing the content into digestible chunks/modules, which helps students navigate the course through a consistent structure. The modules can be organized by content topics, units/lessons, or a time frame (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, etc.). Usually a module includes overviews, readings, lectures, discussions, and other relevant activities." - University Of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Center For Innovation In Teaching & Learning
