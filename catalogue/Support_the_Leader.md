## Context

[Process Tailoring](categories/Process_Tailoring.md)

## Problem

The group leader — either chosen by the group or assigned by the teacher — does not function as expected and the management of the group is insufficient.

## Forces

## Solution

Address the issue by the group leader and start to support him or her if necessary. If this does not work, reassign the role of group leader to another member which is chosen by the whole group.
