## Context

There are very well performed talks available for free on the web. The TED Talks are an outstanding example, but there are also much impressive recordings of regular conferences. But how is a link made to the learning outcomes of students’ modules? How do students find the appropriate videos for a course? And how can you interact with each other?

## Problem

There are too many expert videos online and students can quickly become lost when they search supporting content for their courses. In addition, deep engagement with content often only occurs when there is an exchange with others.

## Forces

 - Good or Bad: The web is full of high-quality videos that tie in well with the teaching content of modules. But there are also many bad videos that can take away from your time or possibly lead you to the wrong mental concepts.
 - Reference. The link to the learning outcomes of a module should be clearly established. A curated selection of videos is useful.
 - Linkage: Often, multiple videos combine well to provide different perspectives. But searching for different videos tears apart the content connections. It would be better if research and use of the videos are separate.
 - Sharing. There should be opportunities to share content with fellow students and faculty. In addition to obvious points of connection, new cross-references should be identified.
 - Collaborative, synchronous, focused: Like a SATELLITE CONFERENCE, there should be an atmosphere in which a topic is dealt with in a focused way.
 - Avoid misconceptions: By just watching a video, student’s questions remain unanswered. Thus, it might happen that students build misconceptions by just watching the videos if there is no one to discuss the contents with.
 - Time efficiency: Finding the right videos for a course is quite time consuming. If each student searches for the same videos, a lot of time is wasted. Moreover, they might pick and watch the wrong videos that are only superficially related to a course.

## Solution

Organize TED Talk evenings once a month where several talks on a topic are watched together and there is a discussion afterwards. This should take place in a comfortable atmosphere; the lecture hall becomes a conference hall

## Implementation 

### Details

A TED evening can consist of several sessions. Each session includes several videos on one topic. The individual video should be 10-15 minutes in length. A session can include between 3-4 videos, after which there should be a discussion block.

Announce the topic for the TED Talk in advance. Make it an
event, similar to campus cinema.

Prepare inspirational questions as food for thought. Work with students to make references to modules in the curriculum.

Time the event in the evening to promote an informal atmosphere and provide a clear distinction from the daily study routine.

Curation of the films can be done by faculty, research staff, or even students. It is important that in each case a quality check takes place. That is, the videos should fit together, relate to teaching and research, and follow academic standards.

### Obstacles

 - The curation of the videos can be done by lecturers, research assistants or students. It is important that a quality check takes place in each case. This means that the videos should fit together, be related to teaching and research, and follow academic standards.
 - It should be clearly defined whether the TED sessions are an additional, informal offering or are used as a basis for examination performance (e.g. writing summaries or learning portfolios). If the TED session represents an official, study relevant event, it is recommended that it be held during normal lecture times so as not to disadvantage students with family or work commitments.
 - If there is too much of a difference to regular lectures, a TED session can quickly be perceived as a purely recreational event and not very scientific. This could reduce attendance and willingness to participate. A good balance must be struck here between informal teaching and curricular relevance.
 - A minimum number of participants must be achieved. If the TED session is offered as an informal event, it should be actively advertised, for example by directly addressing and inviting committed students.

## Consequences

 - (+) By watching, you create a shared experience and thus promote the learning community.
 - (+) Informal exchanges between students and faculty are encouraged.
 - (+) The curated playlists can also be used independently of the event. It is advisable to make the playlists available only after the event in order to increase the suspense.
 - (+) Multiple perspectives on a topic are provided in a very compact manner.
 - (+) Students exchange ideas with each other, learn to reflect critically on lectures.
 - (-) The format can wear out quickly.
 - (-) Organization and implementation require a great deal of time, especially the research for suitable lectures.
 - (-) The relation to the curriculum is not always obvious.
 - (-) The special atmosphere of the event depends on the number of participants, which can hardly be influenced.
 - (-) If, in addition to the lecturer, other academic staff members also participate in the TED session, the amount of human resources required increases very quickly

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - Based on a study with 60 students in English, Tryanti Abdulrahman was able to show that TED talks are conducive to learning. The study showed that TED talks increased both students’ motivation and academic vocabulary [[ABD'18]](../References.md).
 - Another study on the use of TED Talks in teaching context has been published by Mutia Sari Nursafira [[NUR'20]](../References.md). The article highlights that TED Talks are a good example of using technology in teaching. The study presented relates to language teaching in schools and in this context shows that teaching staff as well as students are more motivated and inspired. In addition, they gain an intercultural insight.
