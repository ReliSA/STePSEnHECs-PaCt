## Context

The pivotal point of coding workshops lies in knowledge dissemination, which involves the effective transfer of information and skills from the facilitator to the participants. Most of these workshops are self-contained, lacking subsequent tasks or assignments as well as follow-up workshops. Upon the conclusion of coding workshops, learners leave the knowledge field that was taught.

## Problem

Participants face challenges retaining coding concepts post workshop without reinforcement. This inability to retain knowledge leads to a decline in proficiency and limited application of learned skills. This challenge primarily stems from the absence of regular repetition of the acquired content.

## Forces

 - **Application Challenges:** Implementing learned skills becomes difficult without consistent practice.
 - **Fading Memories:** Event if participants want to repeat the new skills, details from the workshop might be diminished after some time, hindering the recall of crucial concepts.
 - **Diminished Motivation:** Without tangible reminders or continuous support, participants’ enthusiasm wanes for applying newfound knowledge.
 - **External Distractions:** Engagement with other events might distract learners from the acquired knowledge and impact retention.
 - **Missing Hardware:** Not every workshop participant owns
appropriate hardware, to apply the newly acquired knowledge at home.

## Solution

*Gift tangible artifacts for enhanced retention.*

Deliver a tangible artifact to participants at the workshop’s conclusion. This artifact, whether physical or digital, serves as a continuous reminder of key lessons, encouraging individuals to enhance their newly acquired skills. It ideally doubles as a tool to retrace developed solutions. This highlights the importance of its practical relevance beyond mere play. Small objects are particularly effective in this context, because they can be taken anywhere to bring the reminder into different environments.

To further emphasize the artifacts’ purpose beyond mere mementos, it is crucial that these items are directly linked to the workshop’s core content, providing a tangible means for participants to revisit and practice the learned material. This approach transforms the artifact from a simple keepsake into a functional component of the learning experience, extending its educational impact well beyond the workshop setting.

For applying this solution, it is possible to build up upon the previous running examples. If appropriate for the topic of the workshop, the hands-on building blocks from the Hands on first pattern can be gifted to the workshop participants. Sticking to the example of learning basic algorithms, participants could use the building blocks at home to either repeat the topics from the workshop or try to solve new algorithmic problems.

## Consequences

 - (+) Continuous reminders of key concepts fortify participants’ ability to retain coding knowledge post-workshop through **repetition**. As individuals are reminded of key concepts, they are prompted to repeatedly engage with and review the material.
 - (+) The artifact encourages consistent practice, aiding participants in **applying** coding skills effectively.
 - (+) Connections fostered through the artifact stimulate interest,
prompting deeper exploration and understanding of workshop content to increase **motivation**.
 - (+) The lasting impression of the memory artifact potentially
generates more recommendations and **follow-up workshops**, as participants can **share their experience** with
others.
 - (-) There’s a risk that the artifact’s novelty wears off quickly, potentially leading to its rapid **forgetfulness or displacement** from participants’ attention.
 - (-) Participants might become **overly reliant** on the memory artifact, neglecting other revision methods, impacting their ability to engage in diverse learning approaches effectively.
 - (-) The increased disposal of artifacts, particularly in large quantities, might pose challenges in waste management and negatively affect **environmental sustainability**.
 - (-) The use of unfitting objects can lead to **distraction** from the actual content.
 - (-) Preparing tangible artefacts for every workshop participant results in **additional labour and costs** for the workshop leader. This increases with the number of participants.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - *Coding Culture.* During the ”Coding Culture in Oberberg” research project, a workshop was conducted for students age 11 to 13. Within this workshop, the Bubble Sort algorithm was taught. At the conclusion of the workshop, each participant received a 3D-printed artifact as a physical object, shown in figure 1, representing the approach used to teach the Bubble Sort algorithm. During the workshop, participants sorted towers themselves, a process that can also be carried out using the artifact.
 - *Pattern Coins.* At EuroPLoP 2023, the Iba Lab at Keio University brought coins, as seen in figure 2, intended to facilitate the exchange and practice of patterns within a conference context. These coins contain essential information about the patterns they represent. They serve the purpose of gift-giving as an act and spreading patterns in a community that might benefit from their use. The continuous confrontation with patterns in various contexts as well as the conversations the gift giving sparks leads to retention of their content and greater application.
 - The concept of Pattern Cards serves a similar purpose and is also commonly used within the pattern community.
