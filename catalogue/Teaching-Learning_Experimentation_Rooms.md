## Context

Digitization means upheaval for teaching. Courses are transformed, and in some cases completely new forms are created that replace old approaches (disruptive changes). There are many possibilities for designing studies and teaching with digital media - especially for the new media and didactic ideas that are continually being added. However, there often is only a specific use case they have been tested in and a lack of concrete experience for other use cases. So, adopting these new ideas in a new context presupposes gaining more experience with them. This can only be done by trying them out and experimenting with them in realistic scenarios such as regular courses, which can represent a high additional time expenditure.

## Problem

The effect of a new setup is not foreseeable and might not do justice to the time required. In fear of disrupting regular teaching and learning operations, experimenting with such new ideas is done sparsely or not at all. This way, teaching and learning won’t improve, as it will not be adjusted to changing environment conditions and social or didactic needs, over time severely limiting its effect and quality.

## Forces

 - Teaching as design: Designing teaching is a design process that requires prototyping and testing new ideas. Only by actively trying out new setups can we see what works and what needs improvement.
 - Encourage experimentation: Faculty and students should be encouraged and enabled to develop new ideas, try them out, and learn from them.
 - Participation: New learning spaces should be developed together with learners and there should be an intensive discourse on campus about what learning spaces of the future look like.
 - Flexible design: For the quick implementation of new ideas, rooms should be designed flexibly. In addition, different furniture and technologies should be available, at least for testing purposes.
 - Inspiration: Trying out and developing new room constellations should also inspire other lecturers to think about the design of their own teaching.
 - Exploring new technologies: New technologies are often not explicitly developed for teaching and learning purposes, but offer a variety of possibilities to support learning processes. Examples include new smartphone or tablet models, chatbots with artificial intelligence, 3D scanners, virtual reality glasses, or projectors with controllable projection areas ("projection mapping"). To find out what added value these technologies can offer for educational contexts, teachers must have the opportunity to try them out.
 - Linking physical and digital learning space: In addition to  experimenting with different forms of use of the new technologies, it is desirable to have as smooth a transition as possible between physical learning space and digital learning environment or application so as not to interrupt the flow of learning and to link the options for action in both spaces. Since this can give rise to new, emergent, hitherto often unknown teaching and learning scenarios, physical spaces with digital equipment are needed in which various connections of physical and digital learning environments can be tested. Only by trying out new settings can the effects of hybrid learning scenarios be assessed.

## Solution

Universities are increasingly providing experimental rooms for new didactic settings in which lecturers and students can try out new arrangements of furniture (instead of classic rows of seats, U-shape, etc.) and also the use of innovative technologies. An experimental room is designed in such a way that it is clear to all participants that the new scenarios are in part experimental in nature and that the success of the measure is not yet certain.

## Implementation 

### Details

The experimental rooms are primarily equipped with flexible furniture and can also contain flexible curtain systems so that lecturers and students can create their own setups. These setups can change for the respective courses in each individual lesson or remain the same over the duration of a semester. If a setup is to remain the same over a longer period of time (e.g. several weeks or a semester), the teaching staff must agree on a common setting.

In addition, the rooms usually contain technologies that are not yet installed or available in standard classrooms, e.g. learning robots, visualizers or tablet carts, and their possible uses are actively tested. Since the experimental rooms work in particular with new technologies that have not been used much in educational contexts to date, regular adjustments to the setup may be necessary. Accordingly, technical support should be available on a continuous basis, which can also implement special requests promptly in coordination with the university’s existing IT support structures.

### Obstacles

Due to the constant rearrangement of the rooms, lecturers cannot rely on how the room will look the next time. Accordingly, some additional time must be planned for the preparation of the room. Sometimes it is also required that everything has to be put back at the end of an event. However, this has the disadvantage that there is then also the dismantling time in addition to the set up time. In addition, others cannot be inspired by the setups of previous use. However, it can make sense for a room to have a reliable configuration over a longer period of time. Here, there must be a rule about when and how often the room may be changed.

The assessment of whether a newly developed teaching-learning scenario is conducive to learning and makes sense accordingly cannot be made by individual lecturers - especially if rooms on campus are to be permanently redesigned on the basis of this assessment. Therefore, reliable assessment criteria should be developed together with all parties involved (i.e. with lecturers, department heads, students, support staff from the areas of technology and didactics as well as, if applicable, room and timetable planners, building management, university management and others).

Scientific research and documentation of the tested teachinglearning scenarios can be important tools for an objective evaluation of new teaching and learning formats. However, the joy of experimentation in teaching should not be inhibited by too much accompanying effort.

There may be concerns on the part of the students if a regular course is to be conducted in an experimental format. A transparent procedure with regard to the objectives of the course and fair conditions with regard to formal criteria, e.g. with regard to examinations to be taken as part of the course, are therefore important. Concerns about the use of new digital technologies, for example with regard to data protection, should also be taken seriously. Only if students are willing to accept new formats can they be implemented and tested in a meaningful way.

## Consequences

 - (+) New didactic scenarios can be discovered and tested, promoting the idea of teaching as design. Flexible redesigning can also lead to chance discoveries. Participation can be increased through experimentation rooms, as suggestions from students can be taken up and tried out. These spaces give more freedom and encourage experimentation or exploration of new technologies, while fostering a creative mindset. As they give the signal "here you are allowed to change things", a playful approach is promoted.
 - (+) Empirical findings can be collected for the design of learning spaces and teachers - e.g. within the framework of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SOTL) - can be encouraged to examine and further develop their own teaching. The design can also be carried out as a teaching research project. Innovative teaching ideas can only be designed and improved through trial and error. Already tested environments can be an inspiration for further iterations.
 - (-) Lecturers need some courage, because a new setup can of course go wrong. Experimentation takes place on the "living patient" (i.e. the students in this case), without the effectiveness of a measure being known. Therefore, transparency about goals and the experimental character is very important.
 - (-) Preparing, following up and evaluating the tested solutions and formats still costs additional time that lecturers have to spend in their everyday teaching.
 - (-) Successful setups may also create desires that cannot be met with the university’s financial and space resources.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - With the Open Teaching Lab (OTL) , Konstanz University of Applied Sciences (HTWG) has an open teaching and learning lab that consists of different physical and virtual experimentation and offering areas. The OTL consists of an experimental room with multifunctional and flexible technical equipment for the development and design of digital teaching, as well as an open lounge, which is intended in particular to support the informal exchange of teaching staff across faculties. The OTL is embedded in the HTWG’s Open Learning Center, which provides several rooms specifically designed for digitally supported teaching.
 - The University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) offers its teachers and students flexible learning spaces equipped with movable furniture. The learning and teaching spaces are intended to test new technologies and forms of collaboration and, in particular, to provide even more targeted spatial support for agile and project-oriented forms of teaching as well as other forms of collaborative and interactive learning and teaching.
 - With the Digital Lab , the University of Potsdam provides its teachers and lecturers with an experimental space in which they can develop and test their own projects in the context of digital education. The experimental space is intended in particular for teacher training at the university and is aimed not only at university employees but also at student teachers and teachers in the state of Brandenburg. In addition to flexible furniture, a projector and sound system, as well as basic moderation materials, the room also offers a "treasure chest" full of technology to try out.
 - Also in the context of teacher training and continuing education, the Heidelberg School of Education provides an entire network of modern rooms with the latest media technology equipment for experimental teaching and learning formats in the form of the HSE Digital Teaching and Learning Lab . The Lab is intended to introduce lecturers in teaching subjects to innovative didactic methods and technologies. In addition, impulses for exchange in research, teaching, innovation and transfer are to be given.
 - At the Institute for Vocational Teacher Education at Münster University of Applied Sciences, students can design new learning environments for their classes (Figure 1) and experience the didactic setups for themselves as part of design thinking courses. Prof. Dr. Thilo Harth and Dr. Stefanie Panke have presented their experiences in a joint publication [[HAR'19]](../References.md).
 - The educational workshop of the Faculty of Applied Social Sciences at TH Köln consists of several empty rooms that can be quickly prepared for different settings by means of flexible and modular furniture. After each use of a room, it is returned to its original, empty state. Teachers and learners can try out a variety of scenarios in these rooms. The rooms are explicitly designed for the development of didactic educational concepts, with a focus on heterogeneity, project-oriented and independent student work.
 - The Teaching & Learning Lab (TLL) at Utrecht University allows teachers to design their own teaching spaces according to their own ideas. Together with didactic consultants, teaching and learning scenarios are developed. Teachers can try out new possibilities in a real experimental environment. Digital media, e.g. interactive whiteboards, are integrated into the experimental rooms.
