# Team Size Limitation

## Also Known As

Enough Cooks in the Kitchen

## Context

We are setting up a (at least) semester-long, project-based software engineering course, where students are working together in teams.

## Problem

How to best set up the student team size to maximize product and educational efficiency? 

## Forces

The forces causing or complicating the problem that need to be balanced by the solution

 - Bigger teams are harder to manage, especially for the inexperienced students, who are either learning or just learned (theoretically) the project management skills.
 - Bigger teams leave open the risk of some members coasting or hiding their minimal contributions.
 - On the other hand, a team that's too small (and thus, its capacity) reduces the space they have in the project to properly experience and learn project management practices.
 - Rigidly enforced team size might lead to incomplete teams and lone students given the variable number of students enrolled into the course each year.

## Solution

**Have an upper and lower limit on (preferred) team size and set the upper boundary low enough, lower even than industry standards.**

The ideal seems to be an average team size of around four students, but may vary on the course parameters.


## Consequences

The resulting circumstances of the solution application, both beneficial (benefits, signalled with +) and detrimental (liabilities, signalled with -)

 - (+) Team is still manageable in size for novices while providing ample space to experience and learn project management practices.
 - (+) The flexible team size and teacher's final say in forming them (see [Self Assembling Teams](Self_Assembling_Teams.md)) negates the possibility of individual students being left out of the teams.
 - (+) It also allows for better pairing of teams with project topics, which do not necessarily be even in estimated effort.
 - (-) Enforcing the limits or reforming [Self Assembling Teams](Self_Assembling_Teams.md) to even out the team sizes more or to fit differently estimated project topics might still breed some resentment and frustration among the students right from the start of their projects.

 - [TSP](https://portal.zcu.cz/portal/studium/prohlizeni.html?pc_pagenavigationalstate=AAAAAQAGNjY0ODM5EwEAAAABAAhzdGF0ZUtleQAAAAEAFC05MjIzMzcyMDM2ODU0NzY3NTMzAAAAAA**#prohlizeniSearchResult) - Due to the course running for two semesters, the default team size is set a bit higher to three to seven members, with two-person teams being the (purely circumstantial) exception and the most frequent team size being again four students. 
 - [ES](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=541882) - Depending on the number of students in a class group (around 25 students), team size is set to four or five students (in exceptional cases, six students) to have four or five teams of students.
 - [DS](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=518806) - Class groups (of 20-26 students) are divided into four or five teams of 4-6 students of the same size.
 - [Team Project](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/files/curricula/2025/syllabus/IE_sem5_MLE5012_en_dsuciu_2025_9414.pdf) - uses team size of 8-10 people.
