# Teamwork makes the dream work

## Context

In coding workshops, there exists a variety of potential teaching formats. The traditional approach to convey knowledge relies on independent application of solutions to provided tasks.

## Problem

If workshop participants work on tasks individually, they can only draw on their own skill set and thus only consolidate their own strengths and weaknesses. It is not possible to benefit from the knowledge of other participants.

## Forces

 - **Motivation:** Encountering frequent dead ends in problemsolving can be demotivating, especially when learners feel they lack the resources or guidance to overcome obstacles efficiently.
 - **Isolated Learning Experience:** Without opportunities for discussion and collaboration, learners may feel isolated in their learning journey, hindering their ability to explore concepts deeply.
 - **Limited Discussion Opportunities:** In a traditional workshop setting, the instructor typically serves as the sole point of contact for questions and discussions. This limitation restricts the diversity of perspectives and solutions available to learners.
 - **Instructor Dependency:** Relying solely on the instructor for guidance creates a hierarchical learning environment that may discourage learners from seeking help, thereby limiting their growth and understanding.

## Solution

*Introduce collaborative approaches in coding workshops.*

Collaborative approaches like Pair Programming and group tasks encourage team members to engage actively, share knowledge, and collectively tackle coding challenges. This process fosters collective learning and mutual support among participants [FAJ'14].

Based on the previous running examples, the explained solution can also be applied to a coding workshop for learning basic algorithms. Teamwork makes the dream work can be applied at multiple times across the workshop. The first example would be an initial hands-on first part, where participants can freely explore the given topic. When also applying the Code without Code solution, multiple participants could try to build algorithms from paper building blocks in groups. They can therefore discuss solutions and possible outcomes. Teamwork makes the dream work can also be applied when doing real coding, for example when doing pair programming.

Additionally, it’s important to consider the optimal group size when implementing collaborative learning strategies, as well as ensuring an equal distribution of tasks among participants to prevent overburdening certain individuals and underutilizing others. Choosing an appropriate group size ensures effective communication and collaboration among participants. For example, smaller groups may facilitate more active participation and individual engagement, while larger groups can provide diverse perspectives and collective problem-solving abilities. Carefully selecting the group size is a crucial aspect of successfully implementing collaborative approaches in coding workshops. A maximum group size of four participants is recommended [VIH'14].

## Consequences

 - (+) Collaborative approaches in coding workshops facilitate a more engaging and interactive learning environment, where participants can **benefit from diverse perspectives** and collective problem-solving, leading to a deeper understanding of coding concepts.
 - (+) By mitigating quick dead ends and providing opportunities for mutual support, collaborative learning fosters a supportive atmosphere that encourages participants to persevere through challenges, leading to increased **motivation** and confidence.
 - (+) Breaking **away from isolated learning experiences** allows for more extensive discussions and knowledge exchange among peers, enriching the learning process and promoting deeper understanding of coding principles.
 - (+) Encouraging collaboration **reduces** the **dependency on a single instructor**, opening up access to a wider range of learning resources and expertise within the group, thereby enhancing the quality and diversity of learning experiences.
 - (+) Explaining concepts to peers reinforces understanding, making collaborative learning an effective **method for comprehension**.
 - (+) Collaboration ensures that all members contribute to and benefit from the collective effort, promoting **equitable skill development**.
 - (+) In addition to technical skills, collaborative learning nurtures essential **soft skills** like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.
 - (+) Collaborative learning encourages participants to **engage on multiple levels**, fostering deeper involvement and understanding. Especially fast learners find value in collaborative tasks, as they provide opportunities for further exploration and contribution after completing given tasks.
 - (-) In collaborative settings, there is a risk of some participants contributing more than others, leading to **uneven skill development** and a lack of **fairness** in workload distribution.
 - (-) Participants may **gravitate towards tasks they are already proficient** in, limiting opportunities for skill development in new areas.
 - (-) The effectiveness of collaborative learning relies heavily on the **dynamics within the group**. Disruptions or conflicts among team members could hinder the learning process and negatively impact the overall experience.
 - (-) Finding the right balance between providing autonomy for individual learning and offering guidance within a collaborative framework can be challenging, as it requires careful management to ensure that participants receive **adequate support** while still having the opportunity to **explore independently**.
 - (-) Collaborative environments may inadvertently lead to **groupthink**, where participants conform to the dominant ideas within the group, **limiting critical thinking and creativity**.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - *Pair Programming.* Pair programming is a technique where two persons work together at one computer, while developing software. One person takes the role of the driver. The Driver writes the code while the other person, named the navigator, reviews each line of code as it’s been written. For the best results, both persons should be in both positions at least once. This collaborative approach fosters continuous feedback, leading to higher code quality and fewer bugs. Pair programming also promotes knowledge sharing and helps team members learn from each other’s expertise.
