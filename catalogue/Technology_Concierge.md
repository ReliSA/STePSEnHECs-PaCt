## Synopsis

When there is dependence on technology for the continuity of an event, project and task, have a concierge who is sufficiently available and has the abilities and authority to fix the occurring problems with the technology whenever needed.

## Context

You’re planning an event, project or task that is dependent on technology.

## Problem

There’s no guarantee that the required technology works constantly and as desired, and if a problem with it occurs then the flow will be interrupted and it might be that no one can fix the problem.

## Forces

 - Fixing technical problems takes time and causes stress.
 - If you concentrate on a technical problem, it is likely that you can no longer focus on subject matters.
 - Tackling technology hazards takes experience.
 - You need to be familiar with the specific technical setup of a room.

## Solution

Therefore, have a concierge who is sufficiently available and has the abilities and authority to fix the occurring problems with the technology whenever needed.

## Implementation 

A technology concierge can make sure that a hybrid learning space is always up and running. The concierge ensures before and after events that all devices are in proper state. During the event, the concierge is there for support. The concierge could be a dedicated person from an organization. But it could also be a role that is transferred within a group. Knowing that person X gets the role of the concierge has two implications. Person X prepares in advance and takes responsibility for having the hybrid space working. And other group members do not expect any subject matter contributions from the person who acts as a technology concierge – they leave him or her alone and do not bother the concierge. Large enterprises often have concierges for rooms with video conference systems. Universities have a dedicated team to support media devices.

## Consequences

 - (+) Somebody takes care and responsibility. It is more likely that a session runs successfully. People are not overwhelmed because they have to take care of both technology and leading a session. A concierge can work “in the back”. For example, if one person has trouble to join an online session, the concierge can directly support that person on other channels: a different chat program, via mail or even via phone. As everybody knows who has the role of the concierge, nobody is irritated if he or she types on the keyboard in parallel or leaves the room.
 - (-) Being the concierge is a burden. People may get disappointed or even angry if the technology is not working. A lot of responsibility is put on one person. The concierge cannot fully contribute to a session and may feel isolated. He or she may even miss important bites of information. Therefore, make sure to bring the concierge up to date after a session in which the concierge had to do a lot of duty.
 - (-) It is also important that you have a plan B ready if there is no technology concierge. One can either change the technology, e.g. use pen and paper instead of an interactive whiteboard, or make a phone conference instead of a videoconference, or one of the group participants can jump in and try to fix the issue.
