## Context

Now the team has a grip on the assignment, defined tasks, and started working. The next step is reporting on progress, which will enlighten the progress, as well as their understanding of the assignment and shows how their skills are improving.

## Problem

As a teacher, how can you help students set up the right routines, honest and sharp, so that the team process is efficient and effective both regarding software production and the learning experience?

## Forces

 - **Reporting the status of work can be awkward for students**, especially for those who do not live up to expectations.
 - **Many students see reporting on work done as overhead:** it feels to them as unnecessary bureaucracy.
 - **Students lack experience and tend to underestimate the (remaining) duration of tasks.** As they are confronted with this during the first product delivery meeting (which almost never ends with a happy customer); they tend to think: it is useless to estimate as we cannot do it right anyway.
 - **Students have different perceptions of ‘done’**, even when they decided on a so called ‘definition of done’. They tend to forget what they agreed on and offer any result for review. As the reviewers have different perceptions of their tasks too, a review can differ from an approvement based on a short glimpse, to thorough rework of the task at hand.

## Solution

The solution mainly applies to the daily stand-up meeting. In Scrum, the daily stand-up is the primary means for tracking progress during a sprint[^1]; but ‘standing up’ can be performed in any project. Moreover, it is not necessary to perform it daily if the project is not the only concern of the team members during the project period. By letting every team member state their progress yesterday and their plans for today all team members commit to specific tasks and the team knows if their project will meet the desired outcomes in time. Performed well, it provides short feedback loops, which helps students to see the results of their work very soon and to make the necessary adjustments. Team members can join the stand-up online, but the best results are achieved if the team meets in real life in the first weeks of the project.

We derived the following tips for teachers to support students during the daily standups:
 - Join the daily stand up at least twice a week so that your attendance feels natural for the students
 - Establish a community of trust: remind students regularly that they are part of a learning community and that making mistakes is part of the game; ideally students learn from each other’s mistakes
 - First, be a fly on the wall and let students do the standup in their own way
 - Afterwards, provide feedback and let them redo the entire standup applying your feedback. This is possible because the standup is a short meeting (roughly 15 minutes). Table 1 contains a checklist that can be used for observing stand up meetings. The checklist counters the most common mistakes our students made in the past. Typically, repeating the entire standup is not necessary anymore after a few days; it becomes routine quickly
 - Do not only address the team, but also tell every individual what you expect them to improve in the next stand-up
 - Use the tool stack to depict how they can get insight into their individual and team progress (e.g., planning board, remaining estimates, burndown chart, work logs, velocity logs)
 - A common mistake is that the students do not work properly with the remaining estimates. For professional teams, this may be a suitable thing to do, but thinking carefully about remaining estimates and discussing them regularly is a learning booster for students when it comes to providing estimates
 - Be aware that the routine consists of more than the three usual questions: What did you finish yesterday, what will you finish today, what are your impediments? Every student must also reflect on the question: will we be able to get to the sprint goals in time? Encourage the students to also take the perspective of the entire team, not only their individual perspectives.

|Plan board is visible for all team members|||
|Plan board is actively used|||
|Plan board is up to date when stand up is finished|||
|A logical sequence is used:<ul><li>Which tasks did you finish yesterday?</li><li>Which tasks will you be completing today?</li><li>Do you experience any impediments?</li></ul>|||
|The team gives an unisono and substantiated answer to the question if they think the agreed customer goal will be met in time|||
|If the team agree that there are delays, the team lead discusses the impact on the planning and let the team decide on actions|||
|Team lead asks if any tasks need to be added|||
|No vague texts are spoken by any team member. This means everybody talks about:<ul><li>Specific tasks (if possible: issue numbers)</li><li>Specific statuses: to do - in progress - to review – done</li></ul>|||

|The stand-up meeting does not take more than 15 minutes|||
|The lead asks if anyone learnt something which is relevant to others. If so s/he plans when this information can be shared|||
