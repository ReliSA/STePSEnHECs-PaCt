## Synopsis

A Video conference booth is a small separate room or a (semi-) closed, soundproofed individual workstation where a single person can take part in a video conference or make phone calls undisturbed for a short period of time.

## Context

Students are on campus in their everyday learning lives to take part in face-to-face events. In the context of digitalization, however, consultation meetings between students and lecturers are increasingly taking place online, as this makes it easier and more flexible to find appointments with highly individualized timetables and working hours. Student teams are also increasingly organizing themselves online. Several students participate in an online meeting while on campus, either due to concurrent on-site courses or other campusrelated activities, while others join remotely from home or on the go.

## Problem

The lack of designated office workstations or conducive environments on campus often hinders students from engaging in confidential and uninterrupted discussions. This forces them to either forgo scheduling individual online appointments or endure noisy backgrounds, compromising their privacy. This limitation curtails students’ freedom of action. To alleviate this issue, students could reserve and exclusively utilize larger project rooms, even when alone or in pairs. However, individual use of separated rooms isn’t cost-effective due to the existing shortage.

## Forces

 - **Privacy:** Even if open learning spaces for self-organized learning are emerging in many places, there are also discussion situations that are confidential, e.g. discussing grades or resolving conflicts in teams. However, this confidentiality does not exist in open learning spaces where other campus members can potentially overhear the conversation.
 - **Undisturbed:** Participating in a video conference requires concentration. Students need an undisturbed environment, especially if they are making a contribution, such as a presentation. Background noise distracts participants and impairs the audio quality. The use of headsets can help, but cannot block out all noise. In addition, speaking loudly into the microphone may disturb other people.
 - **No room of their own:** Students do not have their own office space on campus where they can take part in a video conference or comparable online formats undisturbed. However, they often need a workplace where they can work undisturbed, but not in silence. Quiet workstations, e.g. in libraries, are therefore not suitable for participating in a video conference or making phone calls.
 - **Temporary demand:** Participation in online meetings is usually limited to a few times a day. Students therefore only need an undisturbed room for short periods of time. This reduces the number of rooms required for individual conferences and the room size can be greatly reduced due to the limited duration, as students do not stay in the rooms for long periods of time.

## Solution

Small Video conference booths offer a soundproofed individual workstation that is comfortable for a limited period of time and enables undisturbed conversations and video conferences. The space requirements and type of use are comparable to telephone booths. Students bring the necessary media equipment themselves.

The boxes should be equipped with a [Nearby power supply](Nearby_power_supply.md) for laptops and smartphones. You can also provide working tools such as whiteboards, notepads or method posters. The room should contain at least one monitor or large display to which the students’ laptops can be connected.

## Implementation 

### Details

Video conference booths are often installed as room-in-room concepts. Due to their small footprint, they can be integrated in many locations on campus. A natural light source, such as a window, is not absolutely necessary if the lighting is appropriate. However, a good indoor climate must be ensured at all times of the year, which includes sufficient ventilation of the booth in particular.

Several [Nearby power supply](Nearby_power_supply.md) connections and USB ports for charging smartphones and laptops are minimum requirements for successful Video conference booths. For hybrid forms of work, slightly larger booths in particular can be equipped with additional media facilities, e.g.
 - an (interactive) display as an extension of the laptop screen.
 - a high-quality, permanently installed webcam for video conferencing.
 - a document camera or additional webcam to record physical documents and share them with others in the video conference.

The standing version of a Video conference booth is particularly space-saving. Students place their laptop on a small, raised table and take part in a meeting standing up. This option is particularly suitable for very short conferences. To create a comfortable working environment for different body sizes, the table should be height-adjustable. Alternatively, Video conference booths can be offered in different heights.

A Video conference booth in which students can sit is somewhat more comfortable. There should also be a slightly larger table in this booth so that students can spread out documents next to their laptop and connect a computer mouse if necessary. This makes it easier to use the collaboration options in an online conference. This Video conference booth is slightly larger than a telephone booth and is well suited for meetings of approx. 30-60 minutes.

A small room of 6-10 square meters is already often used as a [Learning box](Learning_box.md) for half-day or full-day online meetings, but could also be established as a bigger Video conference booth, suitable for short-term meetings as a group. The room could then also be used as a temporary office space for students, providing even more tools like whiteboards or flip charts. This is a particularly attractive option for people working on their thesis or doctorate, not only for online meetings with their supervisors but also for holding an online presentation or lecture. However, this particular use case significantly extends the conventional interpretation of a Video conference booth and could result in unintended, prolonged durations of usage.

### Obstacles

If additional media equipment is offered in the Video conference booths, it should be compatible with the most common mobile devices and can be used by students without prior effort. The equipment must also function reliably. Technical support should therefore be available for regular maintenance so that students can report problems.

In organisational terms, students need the security of knowing that a required video conference room will be available during a meeting or course. It therefore makes sense to have a room booking system that is as transparent as possible and allows individual Video conference booths to be booked in advance - and at short notice if there is free capacity.

The use case for Video conference booths is also important, as they are only intended for use by individuals and are equipped accordingly. However, students may also wish to participate in a video conference for a joint lecture or a hybrid meeting with 2-3 people. For such purposes, smaller groups should be able to switch to [Learning boxes](Learning_box.md). But this is not the only thing that should be taken into account in spatial planning. Video conference booths should also be visible so that students are not working behind completely closed doors. To ensure the necessary privacy, however, it must be ensured that students can position their laptops so that others cannot look at the screen.

Furthermore, these closed Video conference booths are complementary to more open self-learning areas such as Learning isles or [Learning alcoves](Learning_alcove.md) as well as quiet workstations for concentrated work. Therefore, not too many Video conference booths should be planned, but above all the open learning areas should be designed attractively. Students should not work in isolation in the Video conference booths, but should only switch to these booths for confidential, personal and undisturbed online conversations or telephone calls. If larger booths may also be used as regular workstations for students over longer periods of time, this should be clearly communicated by means of signs.

Still, the number of cubicles required is very difficult to plan, as the usage behavior of students depends very individually on campus location, campus environment and subject disciplines. Therefore, the offer should be gradually expanded and the frequency of use evaluated.

Lastly, small Video conference booths can have an oppressive effect. The interior design of the booth can have a positive influence here, for example through bright, friendly colors, good but glare-free light.

## Consequences

 - (+) Video conference booths provide several undisturbed individual workstations in a confined space on campus.
 - (+) Students can work in peace, but do not have to be quiet themselves, but can speak on the phone or in a video conference.
 - (+) Online meetings can be easily integrated into campus life with the help of Video conference booths.
 - (+) Video conference booths enable a variety of hybrid scenarios, seamless switching between face-to-face and online offerings and cross-location collaboration.
 - (+) Video conference booths can be integrated as room-inroom concepts in larger learning areas, e.g. a [Learning landscape](Learning_landscape.md), or in the foyer of a university
 - (-) Video conference booths mean more cleaning work for the cleaning staff on campus compared to larger, open rooms.
 - (-) There is a risk that individual students will occupy the booths for too long and make them their home on campus in order to work alone without being disturbed. However, this prevents exchange with others on campus and blocks the Video conference booth for use by others.
 - (-) The installation of comfortable, ergonomic and well ventilated video conferencing booths is quite expensive compared to other self-study areas.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - Figure 1 shows Video conference booth at the Fulda UAS.
 - Figure 2 shows different designs of the standing version of a Video conference booth at the Ostwestfalen-Lippe UAS. Here, the booth is not a closed room, but shields the user’s upper body from the surroundings on three sides and at the top with sound-insulating elements. A laptop can be placed on a small shelf, and a power connection and additional lighting can also be integrated.
 - At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Video conference booths have been designed in very different ways. Figure 3 shows Video conference booths as a room-in-room solution, set up in a spacious corridor area - in this case designed in the different-colored retro design of a telephone booth. However, Video conference booths can also be integrated along a corridor, for example as a small room that is accessible from the corridor through a sliding glass door (Figure 4).
