## Synopsis

Ensure that all students have a working environment, that is, the required tools for working on a task, assignment or project should be ready and setup at the very beginning. Students should not waste time unnecessarily with fixing the environment until it works.

## Context

A task, assignment or project requires the usage of certain tools, a working environment.

## Problem

Without complete availability of the tools the students can’t work. Sorting out how to get the tools working as intended costs them extra time which they can’t spend on working on the task, assignment or project.

## Forces

 - It’s critical for any learning experience to have a good take-off.
 - New technology often causes skepticism.
 - Trust into the technology needs to be established.
 - Technology is a tool and should support processes rather than being an obstacle.
 - You may schedule the first session or meeting with the students for setting up the environment, but new technology often causes skepticism and could easily become obstacle, rather than a tool that supports the processes.
 - If the trust in the new technology is not established, the learning experience will not have a good take-off.
 - There can be learning opportunities in having students run the installations on-site but problems during the installation may be frustrating and embarrassing to students.
 - The worst case might be that you cannot proceed before all installations are setup and students may lose patience.
 - Asking students to pair up around working computers might be an option but they might still feel excluded and individual work is no longer an option for all students alike.
 
## Solution

Therefore, ensure that all students have a working environment during the very first session or meeting with them.

## Implementation 

Prepare the installation or distribution of the tools as much as possible, e.g. by setting up USB-sticks with the software the students should use or by providing the required materials. If this preparation is not possible, have them do anything they need to set up the environment during the first meeting and help them with problems. If your students use their own devices ([BYOD](Bring_Your_Own_Device.md), make sure to provide all required resources in advance. Make access to such resources seamless during a work session. For example, you could provide a QR-code for downloading rather than asking students to enter a URL and login. If you have a [DEVICE CABINET](Device_Cabinet.md), make sure to setup all required materials and tools before the first session starts.

## Consequences

 - (+) Students become more confident and the scenario is more likely to become a success.
 - (-) Having a working environment in the beginning doesn’t mean that it keeps working until the end. So for the case that something is not working anymore there should also be a [TECHNOLOGY CONCIERGE](Technology_Concierge.md) to help fixing problems as fast as possible.
