## Synopsis

Students meet on campus to learn together and work on projects. They usually bring their own mobile devices to access documents and tools. However, larger displays are required for shared viewing so that all group members can see the content. The use of (interactive) displays also makes it possible to interact with the content and make digital sketches. By providing displays, simple workstations become hybrid learning areas.

## Context

In project-oriented teaching scenarios, students work on a question or task over a longer period of time - both online, in a private setting and on the university campus. Even in small project groups, there is often a division of labor: Students work in parallel on individual subtasks, using digital materials and producing data themselves, for example in the form of text documents, data surveys, photos, graphics or coding. For the purpose of deliberating upon partial findings, synchronizing work results, and collectively advancing them, students typically convene on campus, necessitating a confidential means of promptly presenting digital documents in a visibly clear manner to all attendees.

## Problem

When students present their work results on the small screen of their laptop, other group members can hardly see any details. They only have limited opportunities to place different data next to each other or to point to individual elements and discuss them. The discussion and collaboration potential of physical presence is not fully exploited.

## Forces

 - **Shared view of documents:** While students can open documents in parallel on their mobile devices and continue working on them individually - possibly also within a jointly edited online document - it should be ensured that a shared view of the documents is also available within the group. For example, when working together on a text file, each student may be in a different section on their own laptop. However, if everyone is looking at the same screen, it is clear to all participants which section is currently being discussed. The same applies to selecting details of a graphic or entries in a table.
 - **Ergonomics:** To look at a screen together, students should be able to sit or stand comfortably and not have to contort themselves to see everything. The content should be displayed large enough for the human eye to be able to process it well visually. A sufficient distance from the screen should be possible.
 - **Gestures:** When physically present, students communicate intensively with gestures and other forms of non-verbal communication, e.g. the direction in which other participants are looking gives an idea of what they are currently focusing on. If group members are sitting close to each other, there is little room for gestures, and glances are less easily perceived.
 - **Physical proximity:** Depending on the team constellation, it should be ensured that students do not have to get too close to each other in order to view content together. For example, "leaning over the screen" with another person can quickly lead to unwanted proximity.

## Solution

Group workstations can be equipped with a large (interactive) display to which students can connect their laptop and share the screen. The display must be clearly visible from all group workstations. To encourage discussion within the group and collaborative working, the table with workstations is placed near the display so that students can still look at each other and also share physical materials on a work surface.

## Implementation 

### Details

The size and positioning of the display depends on the number of group workstations. For small groups with 2-3 participants, a smaller monitor, such as those found on office desks, is suitable. In [Learning alcoves](Learning_alcove.md) (Figure 1), such a screen can be mounted directly on the wall. The monitor can often be swiveled to adjust the viewing angle.

For groups of 4-6 participants, a larger display mounted directly at the end of the table is suitable (Figure 2). Students sit around the table in a U-shape and can see the display on one side. With interactive displays, there should be a small distance between the display and the group table so that they can step up to the display if necessary.

For larger groups of 7-12 participants, a large display (55" to 84") should be mounted on the wall or available on a mobile stand (Figure 3). Make sure there is sufficient distance (approx. 1.5-2 m) between the display and the work table to ensure a comfortable viewing angle.

To enable students to connect their own laptops or other mobile devices to the display, an HDMI cable or at least an HDMI input should be directly accessible and clearly visible. For wireless connections, many displays now offer standardized options for connecting your own laptop to the display via WLAN. For older displays, this option can also be retrofitted using external devices. The work table should also provide sufficient [Nearby power supply](Nearby_power_supply.md) at all seats.

In open and freely accessible learning areas, the displays should be secured against theft. Small devices must be better secured than large devices, which cannot be easily removed. In libraries and learning centers, there are usually staff who monitor the proper use of the rooms and the security of the inventory.

### Obstacles

If HDMI cables are available directly to a display, most laptops can be connected directly. However, some laptops require additional adapters. These can be deposited at the gate in libraries and learning centers, stored in a locker with a code or provided by a student lending service (e.g. via student councils).

If all the needed cables are provided for these workstations, they must be securely fastened so that they cannot simply be stolen or accidentally taken away. The cable can also quickly lead to distracting cable clutter, especially during work phases when the display is not needed. This can be remedied by an HDMI access point with a short or even retractable cable that is centrally embedded in the worktop of the desk. For example, in addition to recessed [Nearby power supply](Nearby_power_supply.md), this is easily accessible for everyone at the table and is connected to the display as invisibly as possible under the table top without any tripping hazards.

Alternative methods for device connectivity include wireless options such as AirPlay and Microsoft Screen Mirroring/Wireless Display. However, these technologies tend to be less common, more costly, and less reliable compared to traditional wired connections. Additionally, they require more extensive setup time, making device interchangeability more cumbersome than with a simple HDMI cable. While these wireless solutions may be appropriate in situations where wired connections are impractical, their use should be approached with caution. Furthermore, it is important to note that these systems often rely on remote controls, which are prone to loss or theft, posing additional challenges for usability.

When installing the display, it is important to ensure that it is not positioned in front of all workstations and used purely as a presentation tool. Rather, it should be a tool during joint work phases of the students.

Nevertheless, in terms of flexible use of space, it should also be possible to use workstations for larger groups for presentations (e.g. also for final presentations of a project or Bachelor’s thesis). When selecting the (interactive) display, attention should be paid to self-explanatory operation, e.g. for selecting the input signal and screen settings.

Lastly, broken displays or connections make the workstation unusable for hybrid working. Students should therefore be able to report problems easily and a maintenance service should regularly check the functionality of the technical equipment and carry out repairs promptly.

## Consequences

 - (+) Groups have a shared view of digital documents and can work on and discuss them better.
 - (+) Group workstations with a display create a shared workspace for team members.
 - (+) Groups can make themselves comfortable and work ergonomically.
 - (+) Groups can access digital resources together more easily, e.g. when researching online. Remote participants can be added more easily, e.g. if a mobile video conferencing system is used. For small groups, even the laptop’s microphones and loudspeakers are often sufficient if the discussions are only brief.
 - (+) The intensity of the exchange in collaborative forms of work on site is increased.
 - (-) Third parties may be able to see what the group is working on. If the group feels that it is being watched, this can restrict creative freedom.
 - (-) Problems connecting your own laptop can quickly lead to frustration and delays. Such distractions can impair the learning process. The display takes up a lot of space and suggests certain, often presentation-oriented, ways of working.
 - (-) If the display is positioned too close to the table, this can restrict participants’ movements.
 - (-) Financial resources are required not only for the purchase and installation of the displays, but also for ongoing support and maintenance.

## Example(s) / Known Use(s)

 - Figure 4 shows an example from the Bildungscampus Heilbronn for group workstations with small displays for approx. 6 students each. The displays are directly connected to the desks, the desks are raised - students can both stand and sit at the desk, the seats can be pushed under the desk to save space.
 - A Workstation with (interactive) displays is also a frequently found room element in so-called SCALE-UP rooms (short for "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upsidedown Pedagogies"). Kiel UAS, for example, has set up several group workstations in a SCALE-UP room with chairs on wheels for 6 students each. Figure 5 shows two of the work tables, each of which has a large interactive display at the top. Students can work at the workstations in group work phases and connect their own devices to the display. The results of the group work can be presented on the other displays in the room as well as on a main screen.
 - A Workstation with (interactive) displays can also be found in other SCALE-UP rooms, for example at Ostfalia University[^1]. Depending on the room design, some of the displays are mounted at the head end of the long desks, while others combine round desks with raised displays mounted on the wall.
 - Lastly, the University of Strathclyde shows how to implement this pattern while still providing a bit more privacy, as they created a Workstation with (interactive) displays out of a Learning alcove (Figure 2).
