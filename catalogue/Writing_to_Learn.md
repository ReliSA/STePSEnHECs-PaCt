## Context

You want to engage students and help them process the scope of the daily classes.

## Problem

Students may have trouble developing ideas fluently. Writing about a topic helps them to organize their knowledge. To write one needs to have a level of clarity on the subject, and it will drive you to explore and analyze. This is especially important when taking an online class where you need to engage with the course material more independently and there is no one directly observing your learning. Writing is also shown to improve the ability to remember. In most college classes the students will have to produce written materials, either as homework, reports, or as part of tests. Gaining experience with writing throughout the class is important for their performance and grades.

## Forces

## Solution

Therefore, make the students create a written item during each class and share it with the class. The writing can be formal or informal but must be short. It is not meant to be extensive or take a lot of time, it is not an essay or report, and it can be processed/shared at the start of class within a few minutes. You may ask the students to post on a [Discussion Board](Discussion_Board.md) to make it easy and fast to share with everyone in class. When the students are asked to convey the main ideas of the lesson the answers vary widely. Even with a class of 24 students they do not repeat the same thoughts as this shows the students originality. Discussing a few of the writings in the class helps everyone getting better clarity of the concepts being discussed. As the class trust is getting more established you can tweak the writing assignments to allow for interesting viewpoints, emotions, and humor.

Some students feel uncomfortable sharing. This needs to be respected but you can nudge them and over time most will participate. The writing is not graded, but participation in the discussions may influence the grade.

Figure 1: Writing to Learn

> "Writing organizes and clarifies out thoughts. Writing is how we think out way into a subject and make it out own. Writing enables us to find out what we know – and what we don’t know – about whatever we ‘re trying to learn." - William Knowlton Zinsser, Author
