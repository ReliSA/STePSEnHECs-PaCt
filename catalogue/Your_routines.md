## Context

## Problem

## Forces

As they are novices to ICT-projects, students do not recognize the fuzziness coming with project work and therefore it is even more difficult for them to prioritize, and to separate the important from the irrelevant. All this causes uncertainty. As a teacher it is your challenge to create an insurmountable learning situation for the students. That is, to create a situation in which they overcome their forces, while you overcome your own as well.
 - **Scarce time: was it my fault?** As a teacher you have limited time; you cannot always be present in all relevant learning situations. You need to make assumptions and sometimes you will be disappointed: the students did not use their knowledge from previous learning modules where you hoped they would, you told one of them how to tackle a problem, but it did not disseminate to the others, and even if you told the whole team they might as well take an exit you did not expect. The pitfall of accusing yourself that they could have done better is evident.
 - **Lack of options for interventions** As a teacher, visiting the team, you are on your own. You do not exactly know what will happen when joining them. You try to make your points clear. But you simply fail. Sometimes you feel like you are out of options for interventions, but you still have a lot to tell them. Sometimes you did not prepare very well, sometimes you do not get enough insights into where the team stands. More often than you like this results in treating them as if they were experts already: giving them lots of different hints and tips on both the product and the process, leaving them to select the important from the unimportant. But as we mentioned before: this is difficult for them.
 - **Did I already tell them?** When visiting the team, you try your best to help the team out with just enough advice for them to process. But if you guide more than one team you easily forget: did I already give this team this advice? Or was it the team I visited yesterday?! This can be very confusing. Of course, you can ask the team, but you will discover that very often they also forget.
 - **Guiding and grading** As a teacher you are their guide, but you also need to grade the students in the end. If the team performs poorly, you will experience the attractive force of you working harder and harder to feel confident enough to give them an unsatisfactory grade in the end.

## Solution

In the following, we present some cross-cutting solution aspects of supervising student projects before diving into the specific patterns. These solutions are about setting up your routines for the project period, for preparing and visiting the team. Likewise, the general forces, these aspects are recurring in all patterns.
<ul>
    <li><i>Setting up your routines for the project period.</i> When setting up your routines consider the following points: 
    <ul>
        <li>It is more effective to visit your team five times a week for half an hour than to visit it once for 2,5 hours 
        </li>
        <li>Divide your visits into sessions regarding the ceremonies as described in the patterns, and -mostly shorter- general visits in which you have your own agenda. Also plan for individual talks to students 
        </li>
        <li>When planning your work with the teams, rely on the technique of scaffolding [[KIR'06]](../References.md): In the first few weeks they need far more guidance than later 
        </li>
        <li>It is more efficient and effective to guide two or more groups at a time: your observations in group A will provide you with better ideas in guiding group B and vice versa 
        </li>
        <li>If you have colleagues guiding groups in the same period: set up weekly meetings with them. It will appear that your colleagues experience the same as you do. Exchanging best -and worst- practices will help enormously to feel more confident in the next encounters with your team(s) 
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><i>Preparing your visits to the team.</i>
    
Prepare your visits by: 
    <ul>
        <li>Skimming their work for a maximum of 10 minutes. You will always see something remarkable to discuss with them 
        </li>
        <li>Differentiating: some days you focus on group work, others it is individual work 
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><i>Visiting the team.</i>
    
During your visits: 
    <ul>
        <li>Ask if the students have any questions. Or, even better, require them to prepare questions in advance 
        </li>
        <li>Be clear in what they do right and what has to be improved. Phrases like: “If I would have to grade you now, you would receive a ... ” work very well. On the other hand be aware that students do not start thinking that everything you see will have an immediate effect on their grades. This prevents them from learning from mistakes. Balance is key. 
        </li>
        <li>If you see people lagging in quality or quantity of work: share your observations, ask them if you are right and what they need to do to get up to the right level 
        </li>
        <li>Never leave without telling them what you expect them to do now: “next time I visit I want you to have improved on X” 
        </li>
        <li>Let the team be responsible for taking notes, so that you both can get back to them if necessary. A concise list of subjects you talked about, or an action list serves well. 
        </li>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
